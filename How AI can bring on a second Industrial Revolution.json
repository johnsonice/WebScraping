talk a little bitabout where technology's going.And often technology comes to us,we're surprised by what it brings.But there's actuallya large aspect of technologythat's much more predictable,and that's because technological systemsof all sorts have leanings,they have urgencies,they have tendencies.And those tendencies are derivedfrom the very nature of the physics,chemistry of wiresand switches and electrons,and they will make reoccurringpatterns again and again.And so those patterns producethese tendencies, these leanings.", "You can almost think of itas sort of like gravity.Imagine raindrops falling into a valley.The actual path of a raindropas it goes down the valleyis unpredictable.We cannot see where it's going,but the general directionis very inevitable:it's downward.And so these baked-intendencies and urgenciesin technological systemsgive us a sense of where thingsare going at the large form.So in a large sense,I would say that telephoneswere inevitable,but the iPhone was not.The Internet was inevitable,but Twitter was not.", "So we have many ongoingtendencies right now,and I think one of the chief among themis this tendency to make thingssmarter and smarter.I call it cognifying -- cognification --also known as artificialintelligence, or AI.And I think that's going to be oneof the most influential developmentsand trends and directions and drivesin our society in the next 20 years.", "So, of course, it's already here.We already have AI,and often it works in the background,in the back offices of hospitals,where it's used to diagnose X-raysbetter than a human doctor.It's in legal offices,where it's used to gothrough legal evidencebetter than a human paralawyer.It's used to fly the planethat you came here with.Human pilots only flew itseven to eight minutes,the rest of the time the AI was driving.And of course, in Netflix and Amazon,it's in the background,making those recommendations.That's what we have today.", "And we have an example, of course,in a more front-facing aspect of it,with the win of the AlphaGo, who beatthe world's greatest Go champion.But it's more than that.If you play a video game,you're playing against an AI.But recently, Google taught their AIto actually learn how to play video games.Again, teaching video gameswas already done,but learning how to playa video game is another step.That's artificial smartness.What we're doing is takingthis artificial smartnessand we're making it smarter and smarter.", "There are three aspectsto this general trendthat I think are underappreciated;I think we would understandAI a lot betterif we understood these three things.I think these things also wouldhelp us embrace AI,because it's only by embracing itthat we actually can steer it.We can actually steer the specificsby embracing the larger trend.", "So let me talk aboutthose three different aspects.The first one is: our own intelligencehas a very poor understandingof what intelligence is.We tend to think of intelligenceas a single dimension,that it's kind of like a notethat gets louder and louder.It starts like with IQ measurement.It starts with maybe a simplelow IQ in a rat or mouse,and maybe there's more in a chimpanzee,and then maybe there's morein a stupid person,and then maybe an averageperson like myself,and then maybe a genius.And this single IQ intelligenceis getting greater and greater.That's completely wrong.That's not what intelligence is --not what human intelligence is, anyway.It's much more like a symphonyof different notes,and each of these notes is playedon a different instrument of cognition.", "There are many typesof intelligences in our own minds.We have deductive reasoning,we have emotional intelligence,we have spatial intelligence;we have maybe 100 different typesthat are all grouped together,and they vary in different strengthswith different people.And of course, if we go to animals,they also have another basket --another symphony of differentkinds of intelligences,and sometimes those same instrumentsare the same that we have.They can think in the same way,but they may have a different arrangement,and maybe they're higherin some cases than humans,like long-term memory in a squirrelis actually phenomenal,so it can rememberwhere it buried its nuts.But in other cases they may be lower.", "When we go to make machines,we're going to engineerthem in the same way,where we'll make some of those typesof smartness much greater than ours,and many of them won't beanywhere near ours,because they're not needed.So we're going to take these things,these artificial clusters,and we'll be adding more varietiesof artificial cognition to our AIs.We're going to make themvery, very specific.", "So your calculator is smarterthan you are in arithmetic already;your GPS is smarterthan you are in spatial navigation;Google, Bing, are smarterthan you are in long-term memory.And we're going to take, again,these kinds of different types of thinkingand we'll put them into, like, a car.The reason why we want to put themin a car so the car drives,is because it's not driving like a human.It's not thinking like us.That's the whole feature of it.It's not being distracted,it's not worrying about whetherit left the stove on,or whether it should havemajored in finance.It's just driving.", "(Laughter)", "Just driving, OK?And we actually might evencome to advertise theseas \"consciousness-free.\"They're without consciousness,they're not concerned about those things,they're not distracted.", "So in general, what we're trying to dois make as many differenttypes of thinking as we can.We're going to populate the spaceof all the different possible types,or species, of thinking.And there actually may be some problemsthat are so difficultin business and sciencethat our own type of human thinkingmay not be able to solve them alone.We may need a two-step program,which is to invent new kinds of thinkingthat we can work alongside of to solvethese really large problems,say, like dark energy or quantum gravity.", "What we're doingis making alien intelligences.You might even think of thisas, sort of, artificial aliensin some senses.And they're going to helpus think different,because thinking differentis the engine of creationand wealth and new economy.", "The second aspect of thisis that we are going to use AIto basically make a secondIndustrial Revolution.The first Industrial Revolutionwas based on the factthat we invented somethingI would call artificial power.Previous to that,during the Agricultural Revolution,everything that was madehad to be made with human muscleor animal power.That was the only wayto get anything done.The great innovation duringthe Industrial Revolution was,we harnessed steam power, fossil fuels,to make this artificial powerthat we could useto do anything we wanted to do.So today when you drive down the highway,you are, with a flick of the switch,commanding 250 horses --250 horsepower --which we can use to build skyscrapers,to build cities, to build roads,to make factories that would churn outlines of chairs or refrigeratorsway beyond our own power.And that artificial power can alsobe distributed on wires on a gridto every home, factory, farmstead,and anybody could buythat artificial power,just by plugging something in.", "So this was a sourceof innovation as well,because a farmer could takea manual hand pump,and they could add this artificialpower, this electricity,and he'd have an electric pump.And you multiply that by thousandsor tens of thousands of times,and that formula was what brought usthe Industrial Revolution.All the things that we see,all this progress that we now enjoy,has come from the factthat we've done that.", "We're going to dothe same thing now with AI.We're going to distribute that on a grid,and now you can take that electric pump.You can add some artificial intelligence,and now you have a smart pump.And that, multiplied by a million times,is going to be this secondIndustrial Revolution.So now the car is going down the highway,it's 250 horsepower,but in addition, it's 250 minds.That's the auto-driven car.It's like a new commodity;it's a new utility.The AI is going to flowacross the grid -- the cloud --in the same way electricity did.", "So everything that we had electrified,we're now going to cognify.And I owe it to Jeff, then,that the formulafor the next 10,000 start-upsis very, very simple,which is to take x and add AI.That is the formula,that's what we're going to be doing.And that is the wayin which we're going to makethis second Industrial Revolution.And by the way -- right now, this minute,you can log on to Googleand you can purchaseAI for six cents, 100 hits.That's available right now.", "So the third aspect of thisis that when we take this AIand embody it,we get robots.And robots are going to be bots,they're going to be doing manyof the tasks that we have already done.A job is just a bunch of tasks,so they're going to redefine our jobsbecause they're going to dosome of those tasks.But they're also going to curatewhole new categories,a whole new slew of tasksthat we didn't knowwe wanted to do before.They're going to actuallyengender new kinds of jobs,new kinds of tasks that we want done,just as automation made upa whole bunch of new thingsthat we didn't know we needed before,and now we can't live without them.So they're going to produceeven more jobs than they take away,but it's important that a lot of the tasksthat we're going to give themare tasks that can be definedin terms of efficiency or productivity.If you can specify a task,either manual or conceptual,that can be specified in termsof efficiency or productivity,that goes to the bots.Productivity is for robots.What we're really good atis basically wasting time.", "(Laughter)", "We're really good at thingsthat are inefficient.Science is inherently inefficient.It runs on that fact that you haveone failure after another.It runs on the fact that you make testsand experiments that don't work,otherwise you're not learning.It runs on the factthat there is nota lot of efficiency in it.Innovation by definition is inefficient,because you make prototypes,because you try stuff that fails,that doesn't work.Exploration is inherently inefficiency.Art is not efficient.Human relationships are not efficient.These are all the kinds of thingswe're going to gravitate to,because they're not efficient.Efficiency is for robots.We're also going to learnthat we're going to work with these AIsbecause they think differently than us.", "When Deep Blue beatthe world's best chess champion,people thought it was the end of chess.But actually, it turns out that today,the best chess champion in the

think you'll be paid in the futureby how well you work with these bots.So that's the third thing,is that they're different,they're utilityand they are going to be somethingwe work with rather than

didn't have AI. In fact,you didn't even have the Internet yet,compared to what we're goingto have 25 years from now.\"There are no AI experts right now.There's a lot of money going to it,there are billions of dollarsbeing spent on it;it's a huge business,but there are no experts, comparedto what we'll know 20 years from now.So we are just at the beginningof the beginning,we're in the first hour of all this.We're in the first hour of the Internet.We're in the first hour of what's coming.The most popular AI productin 20 years from now,that everybody uses,has not been invented yet.That means that you're not late.", "Thank you.", "(Laughter)", "(Applause)"]}, "date": "Dec 2016", "title": "How AI can bring on a second Industrial Revolution"}}
