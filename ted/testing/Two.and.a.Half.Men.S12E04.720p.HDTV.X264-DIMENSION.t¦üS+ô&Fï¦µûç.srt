11
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,760
波塔  早安
Oh, hey, morning, Berta.

12
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,780
警告一下  男人在干活中
Little warning, man at work.

13
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,290
這里弄弄  那里搞搞
Doing a little banging and screwing.

14
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,420
也警告你一下
Little warning for you.

15
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,890
在酒吧待到凌晨兩點的女人也是"東搞西搞"
Woman at bar until 2:00 A.M. doing the same thing.

16
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,400
你是在干嘛
What are you doing?

17
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,460
給房子裝嬰兒保護裝置
I am baby-proofing the house.

18
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,390
領養機構的要求
It's a requirement of the adoption agency,

19
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,380
而且這也是好事
and it's a good thing, too.

20
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,000
這廚房簡直是殺嬰神器
This here kitchen is a death trap.

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,190
這里有一大堆能弄死人的東西
Whole mess of things up in here that can kill someone.

22
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,590
有刀  有火  毒清潔劑  滾燙的沸水
We got knives, we got fire, poison, scalding hot water,

23
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,390
艾倫過期的魚肉卷
Alan's leftover fish tacos.

24
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,330
你緊張過度了
You worry too much.

25
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,570
杰克當年沒少吃到地板蠟跟清潔劑
Jake ate a steady diet of floor wax and detergent,

26
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,220
你看他...
and he turned out...

27
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,880
其實你說的還真有道理
Yeah, maybe it's not a bad idea.

28
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,730
我把所有的柜子跟抽屜都固定了
I locked all the cabinets and the drawers,

29
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,460
爐灶也加上了安全開關
put these safety knobs on the stove,

30
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,200
如果你想要拿出那些化學藥品
and if you want to access any chemicals,

31
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,370
會需要用特殊的磁力鑰匙
you will need a special magnetic key.

32
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,050
對了  你洗衣服的時候
Oh, by the way, when you're doing the laundry,

33
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,110
留意有沒有特殊磁力鑰匙掉出來
keep your eye out for a special magnetic key.

34
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,950
為什么毛巾抽屜也要上鎖
Why would you need to lock the towel drawer?

35
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,620
你的大麻是藏在藥物抽屜里的啊
You hide your pot in the medicine cabinet.

36
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,300
我猜的
I'm guessing.

37
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,420
那不是普通的毛巾抽屜
That is no ordinary towel drawer.

38
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,930
那是災難的起源第一步
That's the first step on the stairway to disaster.

39
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,870
我太醉  懶得聽這些狗屁
Oh, I'm too hungover for this crap.

40
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,080
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay.

41
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,740
你想象一下  小孩拉開這個抽屜
All right, imagine, if you will, child pulls out the drawer,

42
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,750
爬上去到臺面上  在爬過去
climbs up onto the counter and toddles over to the window

43
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,490
到沒鎖的窗邊
that has been left open

44
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,040
沒鎖是因為艾倫覺得蒸花椰菜讓他反胃
because Alan finds the smell of steaming broccoli

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,850
所以打開窗透氣
to be "gaggy."

46
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,430
結果呢  小孩看到了美麗的風箏
Whereupon, the child spots a beautiful kite,

47
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,240
很可能是蝴蝶或皮卡丘圖案的
most likely in the shape of a butterfly or a Pikachu.

48
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,350
小孩伸手想抓風箏
The child reaches for the kite,

49
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,100
滾出窗外
tumbles out the window,

50
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,930
掉到雨篷  彈出去  飛在空中
bounces off the awning, flying through the air,

51
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,800
本來馬上要死了  
heading toward certain death,

52
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,930
結果奇跡發生 
when, miraculously, it is caught

53
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,320
他被光上身的馬修·麥康納接住了
by a shirtless Matthew McConaughey.

54
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,570
"別擔心  你的小孩一切都會很好
"Don't worry, your baby's gonna be all right,

55
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,310
很好  很好"
all right, all right."

56
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,320
{\an8}知名男演員  在1993年他出演的電影《年少輕狂》中
有著著名的臺詞"all right, all right, all right"

57
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,050
是啊
Yeah, sure.

58
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,900
我們這次是走運  孩子沒事
You know what, we got lucky this time,

59
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,650
但我們不能每次都有馬修·麥康納來救啊
but we can't depend on McConaughey every time.

60
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,700
行啊  但我以后要把你的大麻藏起來了
Okay, I'm gonna have to start hiding the pot from you.

61
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,620
不怕一萬  只怕萬一
Better safe than sorry.

62
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,140
每個樓梯間  每個廁所  每個尖銳角落
Every stairway, every toilet, every sharp corner

63
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,120
都被鎖上  閂上或加墊了
has been locked, latched or padded.

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,730
沒人可以在這個家里受傷
No one is getting hurt in this house.

65
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,850
燙
Hot!

66
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,950
燙  燙
Hot! Hot!

67
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,650
很好  很好  很好
All right, all right, all right.

68
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,780
你也看到了
So, as you can see,

69
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,850
我在樓梯口裝了安全門
I installed a gate at the top of the stairs,

70
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,910
樓梯底下也裝了安全門  為了額外小心
at the bottom of the stairs, and as an extra precaution,

71
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,900
我在樓梯中間也裝了一個
I put one in the middle of the stairs.

72
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,750
好還要更好
Overachiever.

73
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,720
我想他只是想關住我  怕我跑掉
I think he's just trying to keep me from getting away.

74
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,160
你的嬰兒防護措施做得很棒
Well, you did a great job baby-proofing.

75
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,010
我想象不到有誰在這家里能受傷
I can't imagine anyone getting hurt in this house.

76
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,300
是嗎  你試試說我穿這牛仔褲顯胖
Really? Try telling me I look fat in these jeans.

77
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,620
夠了  收了你的神通吧  霹靂火
Okay, flame off, Human Torch.

78
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,340
所以下一步是怎么樣呢
So, uh, so, what do we do next?

79
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,070
挺簡單了
Oh, well, it's pretty simple.

80
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,350
我走到外面陽臺等
I walk out onto the deck,

81
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,080
你就把一疊百元大鈔放桌上
you put a pile of hundreds on the table,

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,960
我走進來  把錢塞進皮包里
I come back, slip them into my purse,

83
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,430
小孩就是你的了
and you get a kid.

84
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,930
我車庫的工具箱底有5千塊錢
I have $5,000 in the bottom of a toolbox in the garage.

85
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,230
我開玩笑的
I was joking.

86
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,020
我也是
As was I.

87
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,840
我本來不打算在審核完畢前
Anyway, uh, I wasn't gonna say anything

88
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,550
告訴你們倆這消息的
until you guys passed the inspection,

89
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,600
但貌似我們已經找到了
but it looks like we may have found

90
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,790
適合你們兩個的孩子了
a potential match for the two of you.

91
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,580
我們
We're...

92
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,960
我們要有孩子啦
We're getting a baby.

93
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,200
你是說真的嗎  太不敢相信了
Are you serious? This is unbelievable.

94
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,620
別著急  目前還只是在
Well, slow down; all that's happened so far

95
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,090
一名懷孕的媽媽看過你們的資料
is a pregnant mother has seen your profile

96
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,070
很想見見你們
and wants to meet you.

97
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,070
有人看過我的資料還想見我嗎
Somebody saw my profile and wants to meet me?

98
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,540
跟在相親網站上差好多哦
That's so different than the dating sites.

99
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,810
我真不敢相信
I can't believe this.

100
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,940
她是誰  哪里人
Who is she? Where is she from?

101
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,550
她幾歲了  肚子里是男是女
How old is she? Is she having a boy or a girl?

102
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,630
別  別說說說說說
Wait, no, la-la-la-la-la!

103
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,130
我不想知道  我想有驚喜
I don't want to know. I want to be surprised.

104
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,740
沃頓  你想太多了
Walden, you're getting ahead of yourself.

105
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,610
你是說女孩嗎
Did you say girl?

106
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,380
我好像聽到你說是女孩
I thought I heard you say girl.

107
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,820
算了  其實呢
Wait, no, you know what?

108
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,730
根本無所謂
Doesn't matter.

109
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,650
只要手腳健全
Ten fingers and ten toes--

110
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,820
這才是最重要的
that's all that matters.

111
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,740
你不說話是因為是個男孩嗎
Are you not saying anything 'cause it's a boy?

112
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,880
天啊  我們要有兒子啦
Oh, my God, we're having a boy!

113
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,490
沃頓
Okay, Walden,

114
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,410
當你見到孩子生母
when you meet the mother,

115
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,050
你最好看起來是很冷靜  鎮定的父親
you want to come off as a calm, stable father.

116
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,470
不是去參加賈斯丁·比伯演唱會的14歲少女
Not like a 14-year-old girl at a Justin Bieber concert.

117
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,820
抱歉  我們是太興奮了
Sorry, we're just really excited.

118
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,600
沒事  我懂  我也很為你們興奮
No, I get it. I'm excited for you.

119
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,260
等見面時間確定好了  我再通知你們
I'll call you when the meeting is set up.

120
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,660
對了
Oh, and by the way,

121
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,980
我覺得你穿那條牛仔褲  看起來超棒
I think you look fantastic in those jeans.

122
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,090
姑娘  我們絕對會是好閨蜜
Girl, we are gonna be BFFs.

123
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,690
我們要有孩子啦
We're gonna have a baby.

124
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,800
我們要有孩子啦
We're gonna have a baby.

125
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,200
我們要有孩子啦
We're gonna have a baby.

126
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,260
我們要有孩子啦
We're gonna have a baby!

127
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,100
我們要有孩子啦
We're gonna have a baby!

128
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,160
我們得慶祝一下
Oh, we have to celebrate.

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,770
我去車庫里面拿點香檳
Uh, I'll go to the garage and get some champagne.

130
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,940
太好了  我們要有孩子啦
Great! We're gonna have a baby!

131
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,090
我們要有...
We're gonna have a...

132
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,550
等等  我們車庫里沒有香檳啊
Wait, we don't have champagne in the garage.

133
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,490
我藏錢的工具箱
My toolbox!

134
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,960
艾倫
Alan!

135
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,770
給
Here.

136
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,240
我買了這個給你
I got this for you.

137
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,570
為啥
Why?

138
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,540
如果我們穿著情侶毛衣
I think it would be nice

139
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,680
去見寶寶的母親  那更有說服力呀
if we wore matching sweaters to meet the birth mom.

140
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,070
情侶裝哦
Twinsies.

141
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,380
我們應該是以已婚夫婦的身份
We're supposed to be a married couple,

142
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,130
而不是理發店四重唱的兩位團員
not half of a barbershop quartet.

143
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,410
不能兩者兼具嗎
Can't we be both?

144
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,020
* 麥克馬丁小姐  賜我一個孩子 *
* Miss McMartin, bring me a kid *

145
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,620
* 跟你結婚  真是一件蠢事*
* Marrying you was a dumb thing I did * 

146
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,460
你唱太低了
You were flat.

147
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,820
你說那位母親  會不會很辣
So, the mom-- you think she's hot?

148
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,250
她都懷孕九個月了啊
She's nine months pregnant!

149
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,490
我知道啊
I know.

150
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,070
孕婦誘惑超正點
Love me some preggos.

151
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,540
胸圍38  腰圍62  臀圍38
38-62-38.

152
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,800
寶貝真是有前有后啊
Baby got back and front.

153
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,070
聽著
Okay, listen.

154
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,740
如果想要這女孩把孩子給我們
If we want this girl to give us her baby,

155
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,820
她一定要認為我們是一對合適的人選
she has to think that we're a well-adjusted couple.

156
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,620
如果她感受到你那股猥瑣勁兒
If she gets a creepy vibe off of you,

157
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,480
她肯定會立馬轉身逃跑
she's gonna turn and run the other way.

158
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,430
我之所以這么說
And I'm only saying this

159
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,990
因為我深受你那股猥瑣勁兒毒害
'cause I'm getting a creepy vibe off of you.

160
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,520
你自己上網搜"海倫·米倫露點照"  還好意思說
Says the guy who Googled "Helen Mirren nip slip."

161
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,520
{\an8}1945年出生  一生得過無數獎的英國女演員

162
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,960
海倫是永恒的女神
Helen is timeless.

163
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,920
聽著  如果你搞砸了
Now, listen. If you mess this up for me,

164
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,350
我一定會讓你生不如死
I will make your life a living hell.

165
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,440
現在記住  我們深愛彼此
Now, remember, we love each other.

166
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,420
你好  媽媽
Hello, Mama.

167
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,070
你們好
Hi.

168
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,610
你就是凱西吧
Hi, you must be Kathy.

169
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,200
歡迎來到我們的馬里布夢想豪宅
Yes, uh, welcome to our Malibu dream house.

170
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,440
他是肯
He's Ken.

171
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,020
那我豈不就是芭比了
Oh, I guess that makes me Barbie.

172
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,120
我是沃頓
I'm Walden.

173
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,310
他是艾倫
This is Alan.

174
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,570
快進來
Come in.

175
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,800
外套給我吧
Here, c-can I take your coat?

176
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,450
謝謝你
Oh, thank you.

177
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,450
瞧瞧你
Look at you!

178
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,430
-孕味十足呀  -掛衣服去
- So very pregnant. - Coat.

179
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,870
我知道
I know.

180
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,810
我從七月開始就沒見過自己的腳
I haven't seen my feet since July.

181
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,210
我鞋子是一對嗎
Am I wearing matching shoes?

182
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,090
貌似還真不是
Actually, no.

183
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,040
但是一點都不突兀  很可愛啊
Uh, but you know what, it works. It's cute.

184
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,110
快請坐
Um, please sit.

185
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,150
對啊  你感覺如何
Yeah, please. How you feeling?

186
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,560
我的膝蓋超腫
My ankles are swollen,

187
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,940
我的背超疼  更別說我的胸部了
my back hurts, and forget about my breasts.

188
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,550
我都沒注意到  因為我是同性戀嘛
I haven't even noticed, you know, 'cause I'm gay.

189
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,640
那是...
That's...

190
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,300
那是我的彩虹勇士
That's my rainbow warrior.

191
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,350
總是在揮舞他的性向旗幟
Always waving his flag.

192
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,020
即使跟任何事無關也要提
Even when it relates to nothing.

193
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,600
聊聊你自己吧
Um, so, uh, tell us about Kathy.

194
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,410
我想你們應該了解我的第一件事是
I think the first thing you should know about me

195
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,660
這個  并不能代表我是什么樣的人
is this is not representative of who I am.

196
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,960
我剛從加州大學洛杉磯分校畢業
See, I just graduated from UCLA.

197
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,300
這孩子是因為春假時去拉斯維加斯懷上的
The baby is a result of a spring break trip to Vegas.

198
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,640
我猜在拉斯維加斯發生的事
Ah. I guess what happens in Vegas

199
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,380
都留在你肚子里了
stays in Kathy.

200
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,580
是啊  我花了六個月的時間才知道
Yep, took me about six weeks to figure out

201
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,720
我每天早上的晨吐
that my morning sickness

202
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,590
不是一場久達六個月的超級宿醉
wasn't just a really bad hangover.

203
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,820
我們都會犯錯誤
Well, we all make mistakes.

204
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,490
某天早上我醒來  就發現自己跟這貨結婚了
One morning, I woke up married to this one.

205
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,450
主要是因為這不在我的五年計劃之內
See, bottom line, this wasn't part of my five-year plan.

206
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,480
我的五年計劃是念法律學校  當法官文員
You know, law school, clerk for a judge,

207
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,810
開始我的事務所
start my own practice.

208
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,780
哇  真是野心勃勃呀
Wow, that's-that's impressive.

209
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,550
艾倫的兒子  杰克
Uh, Alan's son, Jake,

210
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,940
也有一個念完十年級的五年計劃
had a five-year plan for the tenth grade.

211
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,080
瞧  這就是為什么我喜歡你們
See, that's why I liked your profile.

212
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,750
你當過父母
You have parenting experience.

213
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,970
我也喜歡你的幽默感
Your sense of humor came through.

214
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,720
我有點喜歡你們是同性戀了
And I kind of love that you're gay.

215
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,110
肯定不及我們喜歡自己
Not as much as we do.

216
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,360
-對吧  沃沃熊  -對的  艾艾貓
- Right, Wally Bear? - That's right, Alley Cat.

217
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,540
即使我不能參與寶寶的人生
Even though I'm not gonna be part of the baby's life,

218
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,280
但我也想做它唯一的媽咪
I like the idea of being the only mom.

219
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,130
這點我完全能理解
I can totally understand that.

220
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,030
可能是因為我媽媽是個冷漠毒舌的酒鬼
Probably because my mom was an ice-cold, sharp-tongue alcoholic

221
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,330
喜歡整天購物和做美容  不喜歡跟我一起玩
who preferred shopping and spas over spending time with me.

222
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,730
這點我完全能理解
And I can totally understand that.

223
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,880
跟我聊聊你們吧
So, tell me about you.

224
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,400
你們為什么想要組建家庭
What made you guys decide to start a family?

225
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,880
撫養我的兒子
Uh, well, raising my son

226
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,330
是我這輩子最重要的人生經歷
was one of the greatest experiences of my life,

227
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,100
我想沃頓也能擁有這份喜悅
and I just wanted Walden to feel that same joy.

228
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,530
是啊  對我而言有兩個原因
Yeah, I mean, for me it's a couple reasons.

229
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,400
一是我感覺我人生好像缺少點什么
I-I felt like something was missing in my life,

230
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,140
我想要回饋社會
and I wanted to give back,

231
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,350
二是有了孩子  我才能用多人合用車道
and having a kid will allow me to drive in the carpool lane.

232
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,350
{\an8}高速路上一條只允許兩個人以上乘坐同一輛車使用的車道

233
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,750
能開懷大笑真好
It's nice to laugh again.

234
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,060
不過我剛笑尿了一點在你們的沙發上
Except I just peed a little on your sofa.

235
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,330
我幫你拿東西擦吧
I'll get you something.

236
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,870
其實我手邊正好有東西可以擦
Oh, uh, actually, I got something right here.

237
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,350
寶寶剛踢了我一下
The baby just kicked.

238
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,450
我感覺到了
I felt it.

239
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,900
看來你肚子里住這個足球明星啊
Oh, looks like someone's got a little soccer star in there.

240
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,540
天啊  你味道真好聞
God, you smell good.

241
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,210
艾倫  你想抬起頭呼吸下新鮮空氣嗎
Alan, you want to come up for some air?

242
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,390
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

243
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,990
我太興奮了
Just got excited.

244
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,660
-因為寶寶  -當然
- About the baby. - Sure.

245
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,940
那么凱西
So, uh, Kathy,

246
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,880
你知道肚子里的是男孩還是女孩嗎
uh, do you know if it's a boy or a girl?

247
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,730
我不知道  但你們的檔案寫
I don't, but your profile said

248
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,630
你們沒有性別偏好  不是嗎
you didn't have a gender preference, right?

249
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,550
是的
Oh, that's right.

250
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,460
就像我20多歲時  男女通吃
Just like me in my 20s.

251
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,900
你們倆太好玩了
You guys crack me up.

252
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,240
你們一定會是很棒的爸爸
You're gonna make great dads.

253
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,270
根據我買的馬克杯  應該是世界上最棒的爸爸
Oh, world's greatest, according the coffee mugs I bought.

254
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,990
那就好  因為我已經決定了
Well, that's good, because I made up my mind.

255
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,870
我要你們領養我的孩子
I want you to have my baby.

256
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,630
-不是吧  -是的
- No! - Yes.

257
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,280
天啊  你說的是真心話嗎
Oh, my God! You did not just say that!

258
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,870
你個小賤人
You bitch!

259
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,730
謝謝  凱西
Thank you, Kathy.

260
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,790
謝謝  拉斯維加斯
Thank you, Vegas.

261
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,280
謝謝  破掉的套套
Thank you, broken condom.

262
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,460
你可以謝謝果汁店買一贈一的龍舌蘭酒
Well, you can thank two-for-one tequila shots at the Tropicana.

263
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,760
別忘了肚子里那個小家伙喲
Let's not forget this little guy.

264
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,060
你感受到它動了嗎
Do you feel it moving?

265
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,900
我能感覺到"它"在"變大"
I can feel it growing.

266
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,830
迎嬰聚會最好的禮物
Okay, best shower gift:

267
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,700
巴里  孩子的第一支煙槍
Barry. Baby's first bong.

268
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,460
對
Yep.

269
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,050
和孩子的尿片一樣
And just like the kid's diaper,

270
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,660
里面都是邪惡[惡臭]的綠色東西
it's full of stinky green stuff.

271
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,110
披薩馬上到
The pizza's on its way.

272
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,460
在這個時候  誰想喝點啤酒
In the meantime, uh, who wants a beer?

273
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,460
好啊
Yeah.

274
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,280
開始喝吧
There we go.

275
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,930
沃頓  你會是一個好爸爸
Walden, you are gonna make a great dad.

276
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,400
艾倫  杰克是你養大的
And, Alan, you've already raised Jake,

277
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,160
所以  你就反著來養這個孩子吧
so I guess just... do the opposite.

278
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,040
我仍然不敢相信
I still can't believe it's even possible

279
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
兩個男人也能生孩子
for two men to have a baby.

280
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,860
這到底是什么時代啊
What an age we live in.

281
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,850
科學太先進了  對吧
Science, right?

282
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,800
拉里  這孩子不是我們生的 
Larry, we're-we're not actually having a baby.

283
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,110
是我們領養的
We're adopting.

284
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,090
放"空槍"哈[無精或弱精癥]
Ah, shooting blanks, huh?

285
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,650
如果艾倫懷孕了
Well, I guess if Alan gets pregnant,

286
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,770
你肯定就知道他偷人了
you'll know he's been cheating on you.

287
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,090
你倆真的結婚了
So you two are really married, huh?

288
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,820
-對啊  -很瘋狂吧
- Yep. - Yeah, crazy, isn't it?

289
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,530
不  我告訴你們什么才是瘋狂
No, I'll tell you what's crazy.

290
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,930
你從來也沒想泡過我  沃頓
You have never hit on me once, Walden.

291
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,200
我們每天一起工作  面對面
I mean, we worked together every day, side by side,

292
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
從來沒有長時間的對視過
and not so much as a lingering glance

293
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,470
也沒聽你說過"你今天挺帥  巴里"
or a "Gee, you look nice today, Barry.

294
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,170
"你是不是瘦了  巴里"
"You lost a little weight, Barry?

295
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,990
"這條工裝短褲很顯你的小腿肌肉  巴里"
Those cargo shorts really flatter your calves, Barry."

296
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,120
不是的  老兄
No, man.

297
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,340
我們結婚是為了領養一個孩子
We got married so I could adopt a baby.

298
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,260
我們是假夫妻
That... we're a pretend couple.

299
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,950
就像你"在加拿大的女友"
It's kind of like your "Girlfriend in Canada."

300
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,960
拜托  奧利維亞是真的
Okay, Olivia is real.

301
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,230
好吧  看她發給我的裸照
I mean, just... Okay, look at these nude photos she sent me.

302
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,790
這是詹妮弗·勞倫斯[奧斯卡影后]
That's Jennifer Lawrence.

303
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,670
老是有人說她像
She gets that all the time.

304
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,210
再過幾天  我就是一位父親了
In a couple days, I'm gonna be a dad.

305
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,180
我即將為一個
I'm gonna be completely responsible

306
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,800
毫無自理能力的人
for the emotional and financial well-being

307
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,560
提供感情依托
of someone who is completely incapable

308
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,460
和財產保障
of taking care of themselves.

309
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,980
謝謝你一直扮演"嬰兒"的角色讓我練手
Thank you for being my test baby.

310
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,590
我希望是個男孩
I'd keep my fingers crossed for a boy.

311
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,420
為什么
Why?

312
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,790
很簡單的數學問題
Well, basic math.

313
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,820
如果你有個兒子  你只需要擔心一個雞雞
If you have a boy, you only have to worry about one penis.

314
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,830
如果你有個女兒  你就得擔心所有男人的雞雞
You have a girl, you have to worry about them all.

315
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,220
無論如何  你們都會愛孩子
Either way, you're gonna love it.

316
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,230
當爸爸是世界上最幸福的事情
Being a father is the best thing in the world.

317
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,400
你的孩子多大了
How old are your kids?

318
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,630
我兒子15歲
Well, my son is 15

319
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,480
我的私生女今年滿11歲
and my secret daughter is going to be 11 this year.

320
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,320
你的私生女
Your... your secret daughter?

321
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,370
對  她和我的情婦長得很像
Yeah, she looks a lot like my secret wife.

322
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,220
孩子就是這么神奇
You know, kids are amazing.

323
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,290
你得把所有的知識都傳授給他
You know? You get to pass all this knowledge down

324
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,990
塑造他的思想意識
to this little person and-and shape their mind.

325
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,940
比如  如何向女孩搭訕
Like, you know, how to talk to girls

326
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,410
朋友需要你的時候  如何支持他們
and how to be there for your friends when they need you.

327
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,330
你也可以教他們每回結賬的時候  
Oh, you can teach them your ability to always be in the bathroom 

328
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,450
總能剛好在廁所的本事
whenever the dinner check comes.

329
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,370
那是本能
That's pure instinct.

330
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,460
教不了的
Can't be taught.

331
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,040
我所有的回憶都跟我爸相關
You know, all my memories revolve around my dad.

332
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,280
他把我的電子寵物扔到垃圾處理機里
The time he threw my Tamagotchi down the garbage disposal.

333
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,650
他和我的舞伴調情
Time he made a pass at my prom date.

334
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,660
他和我媽離婚  娶了我的舞伴
Time he divorced my mom and married my prom date.

335
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,680
各位  各位  是醫院打來的
Guys. Guys, it's the hospital.

336
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,990
如果是我的病人  說我不在
Oh, if it's one of my patients, I'm not here.

337
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,020
別擔心  如果我是你孩子的醫生
Oh, don't worry. If I'm your kid's doctor, 

338
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,410
我不會這么做
I won't do that.

339
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,930
都是這么說的
It's what you say.

340
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,820
凱西快生了
Kathy's in labor!

341
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,760
我們得走了
We got to go!

342
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,710
我叫車
I'll get an Uber.

343
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,780
我去拿兒童座椅
I'll go grab the car seat.

344
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,710
我去拿尿片包
I'll get the diaper bag.

345
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,920
天啊  那是送披薩的小哥
Oh, God, that's the pizza guy.

346
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,050
艾倫
Um... hey, Alan,

347
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,300
你能把錢給披薩小哥嗎
could you pay the pizza guy?

348
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,770
我在廁所里
I'm in the bathroom!

349
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,000
他怎么做到的
How does he do it?

350
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,870
很感謝你們能來
You know, I-I appreciate you guys coming,

351
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,760
但是你們不必留下來
but you really don't have to stay.

352
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,530
開什么玩笑  我們愿意留下來
Are you kidding? We want to be here.

353
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,560
有言道
You know what they say.

354
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,400
"養一個娃  竭全村的力"
"To raise a child, it takes the Village People."

355
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,280
各位
Hey, guys?

356
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,990
我可能抽得太猛了
I think I may have gotten way too high.

357
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,230
誰能送我去醫院嗎
Can somebody take me to the hospital?

358
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,510
你這不就在醫院嘛
You're in a hospital.

359
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,250
你怎么做到的
How'd you do that?

360
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,630
為什么我們什么聲音都沒聽到
I wonder why we haven't heard anything.

361
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,550
他們把凱西帶去產房  有一個小時了吧
They took Kathy to the delivery room, like, an hour ago.

362
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,880
有時候  嬰兒就是不想出來
Sometimes the baby just doesn't want to come out.

363
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,590
你設身處地想想
I mean, put yourself in its position.

364
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,150
九個月以來
For nine months, you've been floating

365
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,390
你一直沉浸在世界上最好的水床里
in the world's nicest waterbed.

366
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,250
突然有個人打開了活門  
Then somebody opens a trap door,

367
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,700
水全部流走了 
all the water flows out,

368
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,500
一把鉗子把你鉗住  
a set of salad tongs grabs you by the head 

369
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,480
把你拽出來
and yanks you out,

370
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,800
然后一個你從未見過的男人
and then some guy you never seen before

371
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,890
開始拍你的屁股
starts slapping you on the ass.

372
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,010
讓我想起我去提華納[墨西哥]的那次旅行
Reminds me of a trip I took to Tijuana once.

373
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,100
看她多可愛啊
Aw, look at how cute that one is.

374
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,730
對啊  奶子也不錯  
Yeah, she's got a nice rack, too.

375
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,580
你在看什么呢
What are you looking at?

376
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,230
那個性感的護士  你們在看什么
The hot nurse. What are you looking at?

377
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,680
那個孩子
That baby.

378
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,630
你們真變態
Ugh! You guys are sick.

379
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,920
你們給孩子取名字了嗎
So have you guys decided on a name for the baby yet?

380
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,820
-沒  還沒  -還沒
- Oh, no, not yet. - No.

381
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,920
壓力挺大的
It's such a big responsibility.

382
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,460
我不想給他取一個
I don't want to give him a name

383
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,830
會被其他小孩取笑的名字
that other kids can make fun of.

384
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,100
不幸的是  每一個名字都會被取笑
Well, bad news. Every name can be made fun of.

385
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,820
這不可能
That's not true.

386
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,490
是嗎
Really?

387
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,780
沃頓  你的湖還好嗎  
How's your pond, Walden?

388
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,780
{\an8}沃頓湖位于美國馬薩諸塞州

389
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,880
比較有深度的嘲諷  不過還是挺傷人
It's an intellectual insult, but it still stings.

390
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,460
我中學的時候被人叫做"牙仙拉里"[音似]
I was "Larry the fairy" all through high school.

391
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,030
不是吧  我是"牙仙巴里"
Oh, no way! I was "Barry the fairy."

392
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,930
有人把我的名字艾倫
Somebody noticed that you could rearrange

393
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,610
重新排列后  就變成了
the letters of "Alan," And I became

394
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,870
"小肛門·哈勃"
"Little Anal Harper."

395
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,280
我的名字是"赫伯"[草藥]
My name's "Herb."

396
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,580
大家沒有費勁想哏
Kids skipped the clever puns

397
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,010
就直接把我腦袋塞在馬桶里
and just shoved my head down a toilet.

398
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,920
肯定有很多名字
Well, I'm sure there are plenty of names

399
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,050
是不會被小孩拿來取笑的
that kids can't make jokes about.

400
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,500
兩位哈勃-施密特先生
Mr. and Mr. Harper-Schmidt?

401
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,800
這姓氏也不用擔心被人笑
Yeah, nothing to worry about there.

402
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,980
兩個基佬爹的姓氏用連字符連住而已
Just the hyphenated last name of the two gay dads.

403
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,340
凱西怎么樣了
So how's Kathy?

404
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,620
她很好
She's doing fine.

405
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,320
好的還有你們剛出生的兒子
So is your brand-new baby boy.

406
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,500
天啊  我們有兒子了
Oh, my God, we got a boy!

407
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,180
我可以把杰克返廠換新了
I get a do-over for Jake!

408
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,910
我只用擔心一條雞雞了
I only have to worry about one penis!

409
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,200
我喜歡穿女人內褲
I like to wear women's underwear!

410
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,050
什么
What?

411
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,570
我以為大家是在坦白秘密
I thought we were confessing things.

412
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,890
他來了
There he is.

413
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,450
他鼻子像你  眼睛像艾倫
He's got your nose and Alan's eyes.

414
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,530
拉里  我告訴你了...

415
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,020
謝謝  拉里
Thank you, Larry.

416

看他  多神奇
Look at him. He's so amazing.

417
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,780
想不出現在還有什么能比
I can't think of anything more beautiful

418
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,310
就這么看著他更美好的事了
than what I'm looking at right now.

419
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,880
是啊  說的太對了
Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's true, that's the truth.

420
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,250
但如果那倆俏護士現在開始親熱
But how much more beautiful would it be

421
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,520
是不是會更加美好
if those two nurses just started making out right now?

422
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,990
是啊  說的太對了
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

423
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,360
你還好嗎
How you doing?

424
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,060
挺好的
I'm good.

425
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,560
除了累
Tired.

426
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,100
還有疼
Sore.

427
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,730
看這個小男子漢
Look at this little guy.

428
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,000
能讓我抱抱嗎
Can I hold him?

429
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,700
當然
Uh, sure.

430
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,310
他是世上最美的東西
Oh, he is the cutest thing ever.

431
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,550
來來  擊個掌吧
Hey, hey... high-five.

432

算你欠我的
You can owe me.

436
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,190
一起去游泳

437
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,830
一起去泡...泡椒鳳爪
and pick up chick... ens together.

438
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,160

00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,930

全世界最帥的兩個男人

都是我的
And they're both mine.

443
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,110
怎么了
Oh, what's the matter?

444
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,810
可能想找媽媽了
Uh, maybe he wants his mommy.

445
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,210
好的  來媽媽這  小寶貝
Oh, all right, come here, little buddy.

446

我是說他可能餓了
Uh, I think he might be hungry.

447
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,850
當然了
Oh, of course.

448
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,080
對  沒錯
Oh, yeah, of course.

Okay, here.

450
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,050
抱住
There.

451
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,770
我已經開始思念他了
I miss him already.

452
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,860
是啊  愛不釋手
Yeah, it's hard to let him go.

453
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,100
其實是  無法放手
Actually, it's impossible.

454
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,900
非常抱歉
I am so sorry.

455
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,170
等等  剛剛發生什么了
Wait. What, uh... what just happened?

456
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,400
我錯過劇情了嗎
Did I... did I miss something?

457
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,710
她準備留下孩子
She's keeping the baby.

458
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,820
那法學院怎么辦
But what-what about law school?

459
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,480
五年計劃呢
The-the five-year plan?

460
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,590
當我看到這個小家伙之后...
After I saw this little guy...

461
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,420
計劃就變了
the plan changed.

462
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,530
以前我無法想象有他的生活是怎樣的
I mean, before, I couldn't imagine my life with him.

463
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,260
現在我是無法想象沒有他會怎樣
Now I can't imagine it without him.

464
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,370
但...他會是一個出色的父親
But... but he's gonna be a great dad.

465
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,300
-艾倫  -不  他愛他
- Alan... - No, no. H-He loves him.

466
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,070
艾倫  這...
Alan, it's...

467
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,240
好吧  我們直接說點實際的
Okay, let's-let's just approach this practically.

468
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,740
孩子多少錢
Um... how much for the kid?

469
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,980
我有
Uh, I have, uh,

470
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,580
有32美元
I have $32 on me.

471
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,580
我得留3元去超商買晚飯
I'm gonna need three dollars for dinner at AMPM,

472
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,680
剩下的都歸你了
but the rest is yours.

473
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,580
我說真的  我也很難過
Believe me, I feel terrible.

474
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,420
你還難過
You feel terrible?

475
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,990
我們要開著嬰兒安全椅沒人坐的車回家
We're-we're gonna be driving home with an empty car seat.

476
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,220
你知道等我們到家會面對什么嗎
And you know what's waiting for us when we get there?

477
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,460
一間空嬰兒房和一張空嬰兒床  
An empty nursery. An empty crib.

478
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,930
一個空...
An empty... uh, uh....

479
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,190
那瑞典東西叫什么來著
What's that Swedish thing

480
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,860
那個能穿在身上的育兒袋
that, uh, that you wear like a pouch,

481
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,330
你可以像袋鼠一樣帶著寶寶
to carry your baby around like a kangaroo?

482
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,400
比約登背帶
Bjorn.

483
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,770
一個空比約登背帶
An empty Bjorn!

484
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,340
一個藍色的空比約登背帶
An empty blue baby Bjorn!

485
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,940
發音難  面對它更難
Hard to say, but even harder to face.

486
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,110
艾倫  別說了
Alan, just... stop.

487
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,680
沒關系
It's okay.

488
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,450
換成是我也不會放棄他的
I wouldn't be able to give him up either,

489
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,920
所以我不會怪你
so I don't blame you.

490
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,180
真的嗎
Really?

491
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,350
我懂  你是他的母親
I get it. You're his mom.

492
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,690
讓你經歷這些事真是非常抱歉
I'm so sorry to put you through all this.

493
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,190
不用抱歉
Don't be sorry.

494
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,790
他很幸運
He's... lucky.

495
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,800
你們都很...幸運
You're both... very lucky.

496
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,130
這就是個圣人
This man is a saint.

497
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,340
他媽的大圣人
A damn saint.

498
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,740
我們走
Let's go.

499
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,510
說再見  艾略特
Say good-bye, Elliot.

500
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,410
-聽著像"挨虐的"  -艾倫
- More like "Smelliot." - Alan.

501
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,840
你還好嗎
You doing okay?

502
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,400
好
Yeah.

503
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,370
再給我看看他的照片吧
Can you show me the picture of him?

504
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,170
行了  你別再給自己找罪受了
Oh, please, don't put yourself through this.

505
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,240
求你了  就再看一次
Come on, just one more time.

506
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,640
好吧
Okay.

507
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,210

看看他
Look at him.

完美的寶貝
He's perfect.

510
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,350
很遺憾這計劃沒有成功
I'm sorry this didn't work out as planned.

511
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,520
他還欠我一個擊掌呢
He still owes me a high-five.

512
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,020
別擔心
Don't worry.

513
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,930
我們會找到孩子的
We'll find our kid.

514
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,070
我知道
I know.

515
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,300
與此同時  你還是我老公
In the meantime, you're still married to me.

516
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,970
沒錯  我還是
Yes, I am.

517
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,140
為什么凱西不把你帶走  孩子留給我呢
Why couldn't Kathy take you and give me the baby?!
