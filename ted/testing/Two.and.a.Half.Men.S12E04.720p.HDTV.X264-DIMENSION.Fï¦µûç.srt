11
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,760
Oh, hey, morning, Berta.

12
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,780
Little warning, man at work.

13
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,290
Doing a little banging and screwing.

14
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,420
Little warning for you.

15
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,890
Woman at bar until 2:00 A.M. doing the same thing.

16
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,400
What are you doing?

17
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,460
I am baby-proofing the house.

18
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,390
It's a requirement of the adoption agency,

19
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,380
and it's a good thing, too.

20
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,000
This here kitchen is a death trap.

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,190
Whole mess of things up in here that can kill someone.

22
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,590
We got knives, we got fire, poison, scalding hot water,

23
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,390
Alan's leftover fish tacos.

24
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,330
You worry too much.

25
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,570
Jake ate a steady diet of floor wax and detergent,

26
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,220
and he turned out...

27
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,880
Yeah, maybe it's not a bad idea.

28
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,730
I locked all the cabinets and the drawers,

29
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,460
put these safety knobs on the stove,

30
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,200
and if you want to access any chemicals,

31
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,370
you will need a special magnetic key.

32
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,050
Oh, by the way, when you're doing the laundry,

33
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,110
keep your eye out for a special magnetic key.

34
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,950
Why would you need to lock the towel drawer?

35
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,620
You hide your pot in the medicine cabinet.

36
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,300
I'm guessing.

37
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,420
That is no ordinary towel drawer.

38
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,930
That's the first step on the stairway to disaster.

39
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,870
Oh, I'm too hungover for this crap.

40
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,080
Okay, okay.

41
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,740
All right, imagine, if you will, child pulls out the drawer,

42
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,750
climbs up onto the counter and toddles over to the window

43
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,490
that has been left open

44
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,040
because Alan finds the smell of steaming broccoli

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,850
to be "gaggy."

46
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,430
Whereupon, the child spots a beautiful kite,

47
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,240
most likely in the shape of a butterfly or a Pikachu.

48
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,350
The child reaches for the kite,

49
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,100
tumbles out the window,

50
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,930
bounces off the awning, flying through the air,

51
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,800
heading toward certain death,

52
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,930
when, miraculously, it is caught

53
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,320
by a shirtless Matthew McConaughey.

54
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,570
"Don't worry, your baby's gonna be all right,

55
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,310
all right, all right."

57
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,050
Yeah, sure.

58
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,900
You know what, we got lucky this time,

59
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,650
but we can't depend on McConaughey every time.

60
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,700
Okay, I'm gonna have to start hiding the pot from you.

61
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,620
Better safe than sorry.

62
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,140
Every stairway, every toilet, every sharp corner

63
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,120
has been locked, latched or padded.

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,730
No one is getting hurt in this house.

65
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,850
Hot!

66
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,950
Hot! Hot!

67
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,650
All right, all right, all right.

68
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,780
So, as you can see,

69
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,850
I installed a gate at the top of the stairs,

70
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,910
at the bottom of the stairs, and as an extra precaution,

71
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,900
I put one in the middle of the stairs.

72
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,750
Overachiever.

73
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,720
I think he's just trying to keep me from getting away.

74
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,160
Well, you did a great job baby-proofing.

75
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,010
I can't imagine anyone getting hurt in this house.

76
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,300
Really? Try telling me I look fat in these jeans.

77
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,620
Okay, flame off, Human Torch.

78
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,340
So, uh, so, what do we do next?

79
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,070
Oh, well, it's pretty simple.

80
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,350
I walk out onto the deck,

81
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,080
you put a pile of hundreds on the table,

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,960
I come back, slip them into my purse,

83
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,430
and you get a kid.

84
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,930
I have $5,000 in the bottom of a toolbox in the garage.

85
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,230
I was joking.

86
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,020
As was I.

87
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,840
Anyway, uh, I wasn't gonna say anything

88
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,550
until you guys passed the inspection,

89
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,600
but it looks like we may have found

90
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,790
a potential match for the two of you.

91
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,580
We're...

92
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,960
We're getting a baby.

93
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,200
Are you serious? This is unbelievable.

94
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,620
Well, slow down; all that's happened so far

95
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,090
is a pregnant mother has seen your profile

96
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,070
and wants to meet you.

97
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,070
Somebody saw my profile and wants to meet me?

98
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,540
That's so different than the dating sites.

99
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,810
I can't believe this.

100
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,940
Who is she? Where is she from?

101
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,550
How old is she? Is she having a boy or a girl?

102
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,630
Wait, no, la-la-la-la-la!

103
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,130
I don't want to know. I want to be surprised.

104
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,740
Walden, you're getting ahead of yourself.

105
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,610
Did you say girl?

106
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,380
I thought I heard you say girl.

107
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,820
Wait, no, you know what?

108
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,730
Doesn't matter.

109
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,650
Ten fingers and ten toes--

110
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,820
that's all that matters.

111
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,740
Are you not saying anything 'cause it's a boy?

112
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,880
Oh, my God, we're having a boy!

113
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,490
Okay, Walden,

114
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,410
when you meet the mother,

115
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,050
you want to come off as a calm, stable father.

116
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,470
Not like a 14-year-old girl at a Justin Bieber concert.

117
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,820
Sorry, we're just really excited.

118
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,600
No, I get it. I'm excited for you.

119
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,260
I'll call you when the meeting is set up.

120
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,660
Oh, and by the way,

121
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,980
I think you look fantastic in those jeans.

122
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,090
Girl, we are gonna be BFFs.

123
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,690
We're gonna have a baby.

124
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,800
We're gonna have a baby.

125
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,200
We're gonna have a baby.

126
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,260
We're gonna have a baby!

127
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,100
We're gonna have a baby!

128
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,160
Oh, we have to celebrate.

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,770
Uh, I'll go to the garage and get some champagne.

130
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,940
Great! We're gonna have a baby!

131
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,090
We're gonna have a...

132
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,550
Wait, we don't have champagne in the garage.

133
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,490
My toolbox!

134
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,960
Alan!

135
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,770
Here.

136
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,240
I got this for you.

137
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,570
Why?

138
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,540
I think it would be nice

139
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,680
if we wore matching sweaters to meet the birth mom.

140
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,070
Twinsies.

141
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,380
We're supposed to be a married couple,

142
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,130
not half of a barbershop quartet.

143
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,410
Can't we be both?

144
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,020
* Miss McMartin, bring me a kid *

145
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,620
* Marrying you was a dumb thing I did * 

146
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,460
You were flat.

147
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,820
So, the mom-- you think she's hot?

148
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,250
She's nine months pregnant!

149
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,490
I know.

150
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,070
Love me some preggos.

151
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,540
38-62-38.

152
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,800
Baby got back and front.

153
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,070
Okay, listen.

154
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,740
If we want this girl to give us her baby,

155
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,820
she has to think that we're a well-adjusted couple.

156
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,620
If she gets a creepy vibe off of you,

157
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,480
she's gonna turn and run the other way.

158
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,430
And I'm only saying this

159
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,990
'cause I'm getting a creepy vibe off of you.

160
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,520
Says the guy who Googled "Helen Mirren nip slip."

162
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,960
Helen is timeless.

163
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,920
Now, listen. If you mess this up for me,

164
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,350
I will make your life a living hell.

165
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,440
Now, remember, we love each other.

166
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,420
Hello, Mama.

167
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,070
Hi.

168
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,610
Hi, you must be Kathy.

169
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,200
Yes, uh, welcome to our Malibu dream house.

170
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,440
He's Ken.

171
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,020
Oh, I guess that makes me Barbie.

172
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,120
I'm Walden.

173
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,310
This is Alan.

174
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,570
Come in.

175
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,800
Here, c-can I take your coat?

176
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,450
Oh, thank you.

177
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,450
Look at you!

178
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,430
- So very pregnant. - Coat.

179
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,870
I know.

180
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,810
I haven't seen my feet since July.

181
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,210
Am I wearing matching shoes?

182
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,090
Actually, no.

183
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,040
Uh, but you know what, it works. It's cute.

184
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,110
Um, please sit.

185
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,150
Yeah, please. How you feeling?

186
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,560
My ankles are swollen,

187
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,940
my back hurts, and forget about my breasts.

188
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,550
I haven't even noticed, you know, 'cause I'm gay.

189
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,640
That's...

190
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,300
That's my rainbow warrior.

191
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,350
Always waving his flag.

192
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,020
Even when it relates to nothing.

193
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,600
Um, so, uh, tell us about Kathy.

194
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,410
I think the first thing you should know about me

195
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,660
is this is not representative of who I am.

196
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,960
See, I just graduated from UCLA.

197
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,300
The baby is a result of a spring break trip to Vegas.

198
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,640
Ah. I guess what happens in Vegas

199
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,380
stays in Kathy.

200
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,580
Yep, took me about six weeks to figure out

201
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,720
that my morning sickness

202
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,590
wasn't just a really bad hangover.

203
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,820
Well, we all make mistakes.

204
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,490
One morning, I woke up married to this one.

205
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,450
See, bottom line, this wasn't part of my five-year plan.

206
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,480
You know, law school, clerk for a judge,

207
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,810
start my own practice.

208
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,780
Wow, that's-that's impressive.

209
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,550
Uh, Alan's son, Jake,

210
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,940
had a five-year plan for the tenth grade.

211
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,080
See, that's why I liked your profile.

212
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,750
You have parenting experience.

213
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,970
Your sense of humor came through.

214
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,720
And I kind of love that you're gay.

215
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,110
Not as much as we do.

216
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,360
- Right, Wally Bear? - That's right, Alley Cat.

217
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,540
Even though I'm not gonna be part of the baby's life,

218
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,280
I like the idea of being the only mom.

219
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,130
I can totally understand that.

220
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,030
Probably because my mom was an ice-cold, sharp-tongue alcoholic

221
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,330
who preferred shopping and spas over spending time with me.

222
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,730
And I can totally understand that.

223
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,880
So, tell me about you.

224
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,400
What made you guys decide to start a family?

225
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,880
Uh, well, raising my son

226
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,330
was one of the greatest experiences of my life,

227
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,100
and I just wanted Walden to feel that same joy.

228
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,530
Yeah, I mean, for me it's a couple reasons.

229
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,400
I-I felt like something was missing in my life,

230
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,140
and I wanted to give back,

231
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,350
and having a kid will allow me to drive in the carpool lane.

233
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,750
It's nice to laugh again.

234
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,060
Except I just peed a little on your sofa.

235
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,330
I'll get you something.

236
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,870
Oh, uh, actually, I got something right here.

237
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,350
The baby just kicked.

238
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,450
I felt it.

239
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,900
Oh, looks like someone's got a little soccer star in there.

240
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,540
God, you smell good.

241
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,210
Alan, you want to come up for some air?

242
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,390
Oh, sorry.

243
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,990
Just got excited.

244
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,660
- About the baby. - Sure.

245
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,940
So, uh, Kathy,

246
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,880
uh, do you know if it's a boy or a girl?

247
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,730
I don't, but your profile said

248
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,630
you didn't have a gender preference, right?

249
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,550
Oh, that's right.

250
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,460
Just like me in my 20s.

251
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,900
You guys crack me up.

252
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,240
You're gonna make great dads.

253
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,270
Oh, world's greatest, according the coffee mugs I bought.

254
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,990
Well, that's good, because I made up my mind.

255
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,870
I want you to have my baby.

256
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,630
- No! - Yes.

257
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,280
Oh, my God! You did not just say that!

258
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,870
You bitch!

259
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,730
Thank you, Kathy.

260
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,790
Thank you, Vegas.

261
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,280
Thank you, broken condom.

262
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,460
Well, you can thank two-for-one tequila shots at the Tropicana.

263
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,760
Let's not forget this little guy.

264
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,060
Do you feel it moving?

265
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,900
I can feel it growing.

266
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,830
Okay, best shower gift:

267
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,700
Barry. Baby's first bong.

268
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,460
Yep.

269
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,050
And just like the kid's diaper,

270
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,660
it's full of stinky green stuff.

271
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,110
The pizza's on its way.

272
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,460
In the meantime, uh, who wants a beer?

273
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,460
Yeah.

274
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,280
There we go.

275
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,930
Walden, you are gonna make a great dad.

276
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,400
And, Alan, you've already raised Jake,

277
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,160
so I guess just... do the opposite.

278
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,040
I still can't believe it's even possible

279
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
for two men to have a baby.

280
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,860
What an age we live in.

281
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,850
Science, right?

282
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,800
Larry, we're-we're not actually having a baby.

283
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,110
We're adopting.

284
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,090
Ah, shooting blanks, huh?

285
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,650
Well, I guess if Alan gets pregnant,

286
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,770
you'll know he's been cheating on you.

287
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,090
So you two are really married, huh?

288
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,820
- Yep. - Yeah, crazy, isn't it?

289
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,530
No, I'll tell you what's crazy.

290
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,930
You have never hit on me once, Walden.

291
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,200
I mean, we worked together every day, side by side,

292
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
and not so much as a lingering glance

293
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,470
or a "Gee, you look nice today, Barry.

294
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,170
"You lost a little weight, Barry?

295
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,990
Those cargo shorts really flatter your calves, Barry."

296
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,120
No, man.

297
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,340
We got married so I could adopt a baby.

298
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,260
That... we're a pretend couple.

299
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,950
It's kind of like your "Girlfriend in Canada."

300
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,960
Okay, Olivia is real.

301
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,230
I mean, just... Okay, look at these nude photos she sent me.

302
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,790
That's Jennifer Lawrence.

303
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,670
She gets that all the time.

304
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,210
In a couple days, I'm gonna be a dad.

305
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,180
I'm gonna be completely responsible

306
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,800
for the emotional and financial well-being

307
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,560
of someone who is completely incapable

308
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,460
of taking care of themselves.

309
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,980
Thank you for being my test baby.

310
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,590
I'd keep my fingers crossed for a boy.

311
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,420
Why?

312
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,790
Well, basic math.

313
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,820
If you have a boy, you only have to worry about one penis.

314
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,830
You have a girl, you have to worry about them all.

315
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,220
Either way, you're gonna love it.

316
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,230
Being a father is the best thing in the world.

317
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,400
How old are your kids?

318
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,630
Well, my son is 15

319
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,480
and my secret daughter is going to be 11 this year.

320
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,320
Your... your secret daughter?

321
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,370
Yeah, she looks a lot like my secret wife.

322
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,220
You know, kids are amazing.

323
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,290
You know? You get to pass all this knowledge down

324
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,990
to this little person and-and shape their mind.

325
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,940
Like, you know, how to talk to girls

326
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,410
and how to be there for your friends when they need you.

327
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,330
Oh, you can teach them your ability to always be in the bathroom 

328
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,450
whenever the dinner check comes.

329
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,370
That's pure instinct.

330
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,460
Can't be taught.

331
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,040
You know, all my memories revolve around my dad.

332
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,280
The time he threw my Tamagotchi down the garbage disposal.

333
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,650
Time he made a pass at my prom date.

334
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,660
Time he divorced my mom and married my prom date.

335
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,680
Guys. Guys, it's the hospital.

336
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,990
Oh, if it's one of my patients, I'm not here.

337
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,020
Oh, don't worry. If I'm your kid's doctor, 

338
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,410
I won't do that.

339
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,930
It's what you say.

340
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,820
Kathy's in labor!

341
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,760
We got to go!

342
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,710
I'll get an Uber.

343
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,780
I'll go grab the car seat.

344
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,710
I'll get the diaper bag.

345
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,920
Oh, God, that's the pizza guy.

346
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,050
Um... hey, Alan,

347
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,300
could you pay the pizza guy?

348
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,770
I'm in the bathroom!

349
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,000
How does he do it?

350
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,870
You know, I-I appreciate you guys coming,

351
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,760
but you really don't have to stay.

352
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,530
Are you kidding? We want to be here.

353
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,560
You know what they say.

354
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,400
"To raise a child, it takes the Village People."

355
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,280
Hey, guys?

356
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,990
I think I may have gotten way too high.

357
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,230
Can somebody take me to the hospital?

358
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,510
You're in a hospital.

359
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,250
How'd you do that?

360
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,630
I wonder why we haven't heard anything.

361
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,550
They took Kathy to the delivery room, like, an hour ago.

362
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,880
Sometimes the baby just doesn't want to come out.

363
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,590
I mean, put yourself in its position.

364
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,150
For nine months, you've been floating

365
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,390
in the world's nicest waterbed.

366
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,250
Then somebody opens a trap door,

367
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,700
all the water flows out,

368
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,500
a set of salad tongs grabs you by the head 

369
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,480
and yanks you out,

370
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,800
and then some guy you never seen before

371
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,890
starts slapping you on the ass.

372
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,010
Reminds me of a trip I took to Tijuana once.

373
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,100
Aw, look at how cute that one is.

374
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,730
Yeah, she's got a nice rack, too.

375
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,580
What are you looking at?

376
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,230
The hot nurse. What are you looking at?

377
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,680
That baby.

378
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,630
Ugh! You guys are sick.

379
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,920
So have you guys decided on a name for the baby yet?

380
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,820
- Oh, no, not yet. - No.

381
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,920
It's such a big responsibility.

382
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,460
I don't want to give him a name

383
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,830
that other kids can make fun of.

384
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,100
Well, bad news. Every name can be made fun of.

385
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,820
That's not true.

386
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,490
Really?

387
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,780
How's your pond, Walden?

389
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,880
It's an intellectual insult, but it still stings.

390
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,460
I was "Larry the fairy" all through high school.

391
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,030
Oh, no way! I was "Barry the fairy."

392
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,930
Somebody noticed that you could rearrange

393
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,610
the letters of "Alan," And I became

394
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,870
"Little Anal Harper."

395
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,280
My name's "Herb."

396
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,580
Kids skipped the clever puns

397
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,010
and just shoved my head down a toilet.

398
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,920
Well, I'm sure there are plenty of names

399
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,050
that kids can't make jokes about.

400
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,500
Mr. and Mr. Harper-Schmidt?

401
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,800
Yeah, nothing to worry about there.

402
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,980
Just the hyphenated last name of the two gay dads.

403
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,340
So how's Kathy?

404
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,620
She's doing fine.

405
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,320
So is your brand-new baby boy.

406
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,500
Oh, my God, we got a boy!

407
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,180
I get a do-over for Jake!

408
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,910
I only have to worry about one penis!

409
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,200
I like to wear women's underwear!

410
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,050
What?

411
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,570
I thought we were confessing things.

412
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,890
There he is.

413
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,450
He's got your nose and Alan's eyes.

414
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,530
Larry, I told you before that...

415
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,020
Thank you, Larry.

416
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,070
Look at him. He's so amazing.

417
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,780
I can't think of anything more beautiful

418
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,310
than what I'm looking at right now.

419
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,880
Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's true, that's the truth.

420
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,250
But how much more beautiful would it be

421
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,520
if those two nurses just started making out right now?

422
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,990
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

423
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,360
How you doing?

424
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,060
I'm good.

425
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,560
Tired.

426
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,100
Sore.

427
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,730
Look at this little guy.

428
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,000
Can I hold him?

429
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,700
Uh, sure.

430
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,310
Oh, he is the cutest thing ever.

431
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,550
Hey, hey... high-five.

432
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,620
You can owe me.

433
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,720
Welcome to the world, little buddy.

434
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,550
We're gonna have so much fun.

435
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,490
We're gonna go to ball games together

436
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,190
and go swimming together

437
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,830
and pick up chick... ens together.

438
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,160
Smile. Come on.

439
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,930
Okay, uh...

440
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,700
Oh, oh, oh. Look at that picture.

441
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,540
The two most handsome men in the world.

442
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,510
And they're both mine.

443
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,110
Oh, what's the matter?

444
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,810
Uh, maybe he wants his mommy.

445
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,210
Oh, all right, come here, little buddy.

446
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,510
Uh, I think he might be hungry.

447
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,850
Oh, of course.

448
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,080
Oh, yeah, of course.

449
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,690
Okay, here.

450
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,050
There.

451
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,770
I miss him already.

452
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,860
Yeah, it's hard to let him go.

453
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,100
Actually, it's impossible.

454
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,900
I am so sorry.

455
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,170
Wait. What, uh... what just happened?

456
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,400
Did I... did I miss something?

457
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,710
She's keeping the baby.

458
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,820
But what-what about law school?

459
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,480
The-the five-year plan?

460
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,590
After I saw this little guy...

461
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,420
the plan changed.

462
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,530
I mean, before, I couldn't imagine my life with him.

463
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,260
Now I can't imagine it without him.

464
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,370
But... but he's gonna be a great dad.

465
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,300
- Alan... - No, no. H-He loves him.

466
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,070
Alan, it's...

467
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,240
Okay, let's-let's just approach this practically.

468
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,740
Um... how much for the kid?

469
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,980
Uh, I have, uh,

470
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,580
I have $32 on me.

471
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,580
I'm gonna need three dollars for dinner at AMPM,

472
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,680
but the rest is yours.

473
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,580
Believe me, I feel terrible.

474
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,420
You feel terrible?

475
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,990
We're-we're gonna be driving home with an empty car seat.

476
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,220
And you know what's waiting for us when we get there?

477
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,460
An empty nursery. An empty crib.

478
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,930
An empty... uh, uh....

479
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,190
What's that Swedish thing

480
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,860
that, uh, that you wear like a pouch,

481
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,330
to carry your baby around like a kangaroo?

482
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,400
Bjorn.

483
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,770
An empty Bjorn!

484
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,340
An empty blue baby Bjorn!

485
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,940
Hard to say, but even harder to face.

486
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,110
Alan, just... stop.

487
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,680
It's okay.

488
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,450
I wouldn't be able to give him up either,

489
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,920
so I don't blame you.

490
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,180
Really?

491
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,350
I get it. You're his mom.

492
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,690
I'm so sorry to put you through all this.

493
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,190
Don't be sorry.

494
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,790
He's... lucky.

495
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,800
You're both... very lucky.

496
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,130
This man is a saint.

497
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,340
A damn saint.

498
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,740
Let's go.

499
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,510
Say good-bye, Elliot.

500
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,410
- More like "Smelliot." - Alan.

501
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,840
You doing okay?

502
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,400
Yeah.

503
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,370
Can you show me the picture of him?

504
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,170
Oh, please, don't put yourself through this.

505
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,240
Come on, just one more time.

506
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,640
Okay.

507
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,210
Here.

508
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,610
Look at him.

509
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,350
He's perfect.

510
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,350
I'm sorry this didn't work out as planned.

511
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,520
He still owes me a high-five.

512
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,020
Don't worry.

513
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,930
We'll find our kid.

514
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,070
I know.

515
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,300
In the meantime, you're still married to me.

516
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,970
Yes, I am.

517
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,140
Why couldn't Kathy take you and give me the baby?!
