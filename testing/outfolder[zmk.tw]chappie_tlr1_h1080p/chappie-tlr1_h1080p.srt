People are always fearful of something they don't understand

14
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,320
A problem without a fissional intelligence, it is why too unpredictable

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,475

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,050
It could be the next step in evolution

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,060
