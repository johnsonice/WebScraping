1
00:00:14,576 --> 00:00:16,676
-嘿 JB 你猜怎么着 -你应该知道这车是
- Hey, JB, guess what. - You know this is a manual

2
00:00:16,678 --> 00:00:18,178
手动挡不是自动挡 对吧
and not an automatic, right?

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,913
让我歇会儿 行吗
Give me a break, will you?

4
00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:21,782
天快亮了 我很累
It's almost dawn. I'm tired.

5
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:23,116
况且我在捍卫你自由的时候
And I don't do a lot of driving

6
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:24,484
也不经常开车
when I'm protecting your freedom.

7
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:27,687
我的自由之一就是嘲笑你的烂车技
Which includes the freedom to mock your bad driving skills.

8
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,657
-你们这帮损友... -你知道我们很爱你
- With friends like you guys... - Aw, you know we love you.

9
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:33,226
是啊 我们只是通过直击灵魂的嘲讽来表达对你的喜爱
Yeah, we just like to show it through soul-crushing ridicule.

10
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:34,194
是的
Yeah!

11
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:36,263
是么 那真是谢谢你了 兄弟
Yeah, thank you, man.

12
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:37,831
我精疲力尽了
I am wiped out.

13
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,399
JB 你的假期什么时候结束
JB, when's your leave over?

14
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:41,401
大概就是几天后吧 新一轮部署又要开始了
Uh, next deployment starts in a few days.

15
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:44,137
还是回家比较有意思
It's been fun being home, though.

16
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:45,705
我还觉得自己是刚回来呢
I feel like I just got back.

17
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:07,260
快止血 保持镇定 好吗
...stop the bleeding... just need to stay calm, all right?

18
00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:08,495
会没事的
Gonna be all right.

19
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:14,434
会没事的 坚持住
Gonna be fine. Stay with me.

20
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,684
-她 她喘不上气了 -好了 我们会让你
- Sh-She can't breathe. - Okay, we're gonna get you

21
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:31,751
呼吸顺畅些 好吗
breathing again, all right?

22
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:34,120
-帮帮她 -你要保持这个姿势别动
- Help her! - You need to stay very still.

23
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:35,689
救救她
Help her!

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,727
你很快会呼吸顺畅的 相信我
This is gonna make it easier for you, okay?

25
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:41,895
现在 呼吸
Now breathe.

26
00:01:41,897 --> 00:01:44,898
吸气 呼气
Breathe, breathe...

27
00:01:45,077 --> 00:01:49,077

30
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:21,268
谢谢你把他带回家了 警官
Thank you for bringing him home, Officer. I promise

31
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,869
-我保证没有下次了 -McGee
- this will never happen again. - McGee--

32
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:24,571
我是怎么跟你说 从华盛顿纪念碑上
what did I tell you about throwing pennies

33
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:26,273
往下扔钢G儿那事的
off the top of the Washington Monument?

34
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,475
噢 Tony 说得好像你在那接着似的
Oh, Tony, if only you were there to catch them.

35
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:29,976
那我会这么接
I would catch them like this.

36
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:31,444
嗨 Tony
Hi, Tony.

37
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:32,479
你好 Burt中士
Hi, Sergeant Burt.

38
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:34,180
你们这么早过来干什么
So, what are you doing here so early?

39
00:02:34,182 --> 00:02:36,616
来接人还是来送啊
Picking up or dropping off?

40
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:37,918
Abby和我一起用的早餐
Abby and I had breakfast.

41
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,386
就在
After...

42
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:42,022
-我去她家接她以后 -有意思
- I picked her up from her place. - Mmm.

43
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:43,957
早餐啊 你们吃了什么
Breakfast. What'd you have?

44
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:45,526
抱歉 我饿了
Sorry, I'm starving.

45
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:46,960
我想听你说说 解解馋
Thought I'd live vicariously.

46
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:47,861
你真的饿了吗 Bishop
You're hungry, Bishop?

47
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:49,329
她总是觉得饿
She's always hungry.

48
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:51,064
我是说 你可别被菜鸟那娇小玲珑
I mean, don't let the probie's tiny,

49
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:52,299
低调谦逊的外形骗了
unassuming frame fool you.

50
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:53,500
千万不要
No.

51
00:02:53,502 --> 00:02:55,135
她会毫不留情地把你整个吃掉
She'll swallow you whole.

52
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:56,303
我不怕
I'm not afraid.

53
00:02:56,305 --> 00:02:58,371
我不吃人 Tony
I'm not a cannibal, Tony.

54
00:02:58,373 --> 00:02:59,806
也许这就是我们从没见过Jake的原因
Maybe that's why we never see Jake.

55
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:01,041
大概是她把他吃了
Maybe she ate him.

56
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:02,375
也可能是他比较忙
Or maybe he's just busy.

57
00:03:02,377 --> 00:03:05,245
又或者你把他吃了 还配上蚕豆和意大利红酒
【注：《沉默的羔羊》中汉尼拔经典语录】
Or maybe you had him with fava beans and a nice Chianti.

58
00:03:06,715 --> 00:03:08,949
Burt 你和Abby之间是怎么回事
So, Burt, how are things going between you and Abby?

59
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:10,951
我从来没遇到过她这样的女人 McGee探员
Never met anyone like her, Agent McGee.

60
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:13,019
很棒 她很棒
It's been great. She's great.

61
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:14,588
超乎寻常的棒
Beyond great.

62
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,957
似乎一切都
Everything has just been...

63
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,558
-很棒 -很棒
- Great. - Great?

64
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,060
就这个意思
Exactly.

65
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:22,295
我们一拍即合
We just click.

66
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:24,731
-你懂吗 -是啊是啊 我懂的
- You know? - Yeah. Yeah, I know.

67
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,167
那么 从一切都变得很...棒开始
So, how long has it been since everything

68
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,935
到现在有多长时间了
started being... great?

69
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:30,670
两个月了吧
A couple of months.

70
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:31,938
相差不多 大概就是两个月
Give or take, I guess.

71
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,176
天呐 我得去做安全简报了 我快迟到了
Oh, boy, I'm gonna be late to my security briefing.

72
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:37,811
我得走了 回见 各位
Gotta go. I'll see you guys later.

73
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:41,481
好吧 有时间再见 两个月先生
【注：电影《阿波罗13号》中经典台词】
All right. Catch you on the flip side, Mr. Two-months.

74
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:44,250
可怜的汉子
Poor bastard.

75
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:46,419
我还挺喜欢他 个子又高 人又老实
Yeah, I really liked him. Tall, quiet.

76
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,456
很有“万宝路男人”沧桑成熟的样子
Had a sort of Marlboro Man quality to him.

77
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,324
为什么你们两个说得好像
Why are you two talking about Burt

78
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:53,259
再也见不到Burt一样
like you're never going to see him again?

79
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:54,394
Burt哪儿去了
Hey, where's Burt going?

80
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:56,896
-两个月了 -明白了
- Two months. - Copy that.

81
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:58,765
拿上装备
Grab your gear.

82
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:00,834
一个士官死于疑似肇事逃逸
Petty officer killed in a possible hit-and-run.

83
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:02,002
解释下呗
Um, hello?

84
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,374
我是不是错过了什么
Did I miss something?

85
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:12,045
你有什么发现 Duck
What do you got, Duck?

86
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:13,947
除了清新的秋日空气
Besides the crisp autumnal air,

87
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:15,348
干燥的叶子散发出的橡木味儿
the scent of dried oak leaves

88
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,917
还有冬日老人敲响
and the knock-knock of Old Man Winter

89
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,553
自然母亲前门的声音吗
on Mother Nature's front door?

90
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:21,921
是的 除了那些
Yeah. Besides that.

91
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:23,523
恐怕是个悲剧
Tragedy, I'm afraid.

92
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:27,093
不过在这种情况下 我还是很高兴看到罪魁祸首是这条平坦光滑的公路
Though, in this instance, I'm glad the culprit is a slick road

93
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:29,929
而不是边看短信边开车的傻瓜
and not a foolish texting fatality.

94
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:31,331
我记得他们说是肇事逃逸
I thought they said hit-and-run?

95
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,432
当地警察说有个目击者
Well, local LEOs have one witness

96
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:34,434
似乎看到事故发生时一辆SUV加速开走了
who might have seen an SUV speeding away,

97
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:36,436
但相关描述非常粗略
but it sounds sketchy.

98
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:38,738
-死者呢 -士官
- Victim? - Petty Officer

99
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,507
John Blaney Hicks 他是本地人
John Blaney Hicks. He was a local.

100
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,542
从"温斯洛普"号军舰上休假在家
Home on leave from the USS<i> Winthrop.</i>

101
00:04:42,544 --> 00:04:45,045
有两个朋友和他一起 都是平民
Had two friends with him, both civilian.

102
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:47,347
他们被紧急送往医院时状况很不好
They were rushed to the hospital in critical condition.

103
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:49,382
看起来是车失控了
Looks like he lost control of the vehicle,

104
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:50,884
撞到了那边的栅栏
took out a fence up there

105
00:04:50,886 --> 00:04:52,552
接着翻滚下山
and did a triple gainer down the hill.

106
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:53,987
-有刹车滑痕吗  -有一条
- Skid marks? - One set,

107
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:55,055
从那边的路上延伸过来
leading off the road.

108
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:57,457
栅栏刺破了挡风玻璃
Fence post went through the windshield.

109
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:00,427
士官脖子上的伤口就是
Yeah, and the wound on the petty officer's neck

110
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:02,762
他失血而亡的原因
suggests that it caused him to bleed out.

111
00:05:02,764 --> 00:05:04,397
这些纱布是哪来的
Where'd all these bandages come from?

112
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,067
我知道是怎么回事
I think I can answer that.

113
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:09,069
我在死者的伤口上
I found what appears to be cornstarch powder

114
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:10,670
发现了玉米粉
on the victim's wounds.

115
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:13,473
玉米 玉米可有很多用途
Cornstarch-- there's so many uses for cornstarch.

116
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:15,809
我记得我的表姐Beatrice能用橘子和玉米粉
I remember my cousin Beatrice used to make the best

117
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:17,610
做出最好吃的华夫饼
orange and cranberry muffins,

118
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:18,845
她每次都不让我多吃
she'd have me add just a pinch,

119
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,880
然后
and it...

120
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:23,349
呃 还有医用手套
Um, the medical gloves--

121
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:26,720
急救人员大概是想抢救他
the EMTs probably tried to save him.

122
00:05:26,722 --> 00:05:28,621
但救护车20分钟后才到
But it took EMTs 20 minutes to get here.

123
00:05:28,623 --> 00:05:30,323
那他们给死人贴纱布干嘛
Why would they bandage a dead man?

124
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:32,025
他们没有
They wouldn't.

125
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:36,062
我是Sherman Harper警官 来自费尔法克斯县警局
Sergeant Sherman Harper, Fairfax County PD.

126
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:38,064
我是特别探员Gibbs
Special Agent Gibbs.

127
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:39,566
谢谢你长途跋涉而来
Thanks for making the trek.

128
00:05:39,568 --> 00:05:42,068
消防部门和医疗救护员没有碰过死者
Fire department EMTs didn't do a thing to your petty officer.

129
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,604
他们是接警后赶来 赶到时
They responded to a 911 call, when they got here,

130
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:46,039
他已经被包扎过了
he was bandaged up already.

131
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,407
他的朋友也一样
Same with his friends.

132
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,641
谁试图救他呢
Who tried to save them?

133
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:50,343
是她
She did.

134
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:53,012
现场急救员说当他们阻止时
First responders say she was holding a trach tube

135
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:54,848
她正扶着一个姑娘喉咙里的导气管
in the girl's throat when they pulled up.

136
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,585
她到底是谁
Who exactly is she?

137
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:04,457
驾驶证上显示她叫Anna Dillon

Public defender?

276
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,345
别太期待
Yeah, don't hold your breath.

277
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:06,513
你是NCIS的人
Well, you're NCIS.

278
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:07,915
他们说 我也不能和你交谈
They'd tell me not to talk to you, either.

279
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:10,350
也许吧
Yeah, maybe.

280
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:12,085
所以
So?

281
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:16,156
所以...他们不会理解
So... they won't understand.

282
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:17,624
他们不知道你是谁
They don't know who you are,

283
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:19,660
不知道你做过什么
they don't know what you've done.

284
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:22,496
我们想要帮忙
We want to help.

285
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:24,665
我很高兴听到这个 但是太晚了 长官
Well, I'm glad to hear that, but it's too late, sir.

286
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,867
我打了911
I called 911.

287
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:28,936
我想要去帮那些孩子 但是其中一个死了
I tried to help those kids and one's dead.

288
00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:30,704
但是因为你 有两个人活了下来
Yeah, but two are alive because of you.

289
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:31,905
应该有三个人活下来的
There should be three.

290
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:33,073
我犹豫了
I hesitated.

291
00:12:33,075 --> 00:12:34,508
不能怪你自己
Can't blame yourself.

292
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,210
我到那的时候 他还活着
He was alive when I got there.

293
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:38,011
我离开的时候 他已经死了
He was dead when I left.

294
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:40,347
我知道我可以做的更多
I know I could have done more.

295
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:46,320
呃...
Uh...

296
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:52,960
坐下吧
Sit down.

297
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:06,173
为什么不跑呢 Dillon
Why not run, Dillon?

298
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,441
为什么代人受罪
Why take the fall?

299
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:08,909
我有想过
I thought about it.

300
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:11,378
但 你还是留下了
Yeah... but you stayed.

301
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,946
我必须留下
I had to.

302
00:13:12,948 --> 00:13:14,882
我接受的训练就是这样
I'm trained to.

303
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:18,919
我必须得说 这不是我预期的未来
I gotta say, this is not exactly the vision I had for my future.

304
00:13:18,921 --> 00:13:21,455
我和那些急救员唯一的差别是
Only damn difference between me and those EMTs

305
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:23,657
-我们开不同的车到现场 -对
- is the car we drove up in. - Yeah.

306
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:25,292
还有法律上的差别
And the law.

307
00:13:25,294 --> 00:13:27,427
我接受过那些训练 你知道的
I have the training, you know that.

308
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:28,929
自从我离开军队
Ever since I got out,

309
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:31,565
没能找到那方面的工作
I can't get a single job in the field.

310
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:34,635
我一直存钱 想攻读医学院
I've been saving to go to medical school.

311
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:36,436
但即使我被释放了
But even if I'm cleared,

312
00:13:36,438 --> 00:13:39,139
这件事还会记录在我的档案上 你觉得会有人要我吗
you think anyone will accept me with this on my record?

313
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,411
我和陆军空军的军医学习的东西一样
I learned the same as the Army and the Air Force medics,

314
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:46,847
但是因为某些原因 他们出来的时候起码是个急救员
and for some reason, they come out EMT-Basic,

315
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:50,284
他们救那些孩子就是合法的
and-and they could have legally saved those kids.

316
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:54,688
我怎么就犯法了呢
Why can't I?

317
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:01,061
特别探员Gibbs 知道自己在做什么吗
Special Agent Gibbs, what do you think you're doing?

318
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:02,796
她还没有因任何罪名被起诉
She hasn't been charged with a crime yet.

319
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:05,332
她被公诉人拘留了
She's being detained for the prosecutor,

320
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:07,100
-公诉人正在他路上 -不
-who's on his way. -No.

321
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:08,135
公诉人不来了
Not anymore.

322
00:14:08,137 --> 00:14:09,970
-你打电话了 -不 不是我
- You make a call? - No, not me.

323
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:12,372
是东部地区律师协会打的电话
U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District.

324
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:15,008
我知道她以前是海军
I know she's former Navy.

325
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,443
JB也是个海军
JB was Navy, too.

326
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:18,745
我比你想象的更尊重这身制服
I respect the uniform more than you know.

327
00:14:18,747 --> 00:14:20,981
但她不应该碰他们
But she shouldn't have touched them.

328
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:22,516
她应该等待别人帮忙
She should have waited for help.

329
00:14:22,518 --> 00:14:23,817
等待
Waited?

330
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:25,419
等待 看着他们死
Waited and watched them die?

331
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:26,920
小姐 我不是说这么做是对的
Miss, I'm not saying it's right.

332
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:28,221
但你的确违法了
But you broke the law.

333
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:29,890
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

334
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:31,925
你为什么不去找肇事者
Why aren't you looking for the person who caused this crash?

335
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:35,028
-这是场意外 -不 不是
- It was an accident. - No, it wasn't.

336
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:37,965
警官 听着
Sergeant, look...

337
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,800
我们都想解决这个案子
we all want to solve this case,

338
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:41,768
但我们需要她的帮忙
but we need her help to do it.

339
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,036
如果你想要询问她
You want to question her?

340
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:44,137
你在这儿询问
You do it here.

341
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:45,806
用我的办公室 想怎么做都行
Use my office, whatever you need.

342
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:47,541
这不是关于询问
This isn't about questioning.

343
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:50,010
这是关于做正确的事情
This is about doing what's right.

344
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:52,813
Mary LaFleur 车里的一个乘客
Mary LaFleur, a passenger in that car,

345
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:54,448
刚刚从手术室出来
just got out of surgery.

346
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,450
她可能瘫痪了
She may be paralyzed.

347
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,652
你的医护兵在车祸后移动了她
Your corpsman moved her after the crash.

348
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:00,654
我做的都是对的
I did everything right.

349
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:02,022
跟急救员说去
Talk to the EMTs.

350
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:03,457
你不能为此责备我
You can't blame me for that.

351
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:05,025
我认识Mary的父母
I know Mary's parents.

352
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:07,260
我必须要回答她遭受了什么
I have to answer for what was done to her.

353
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,696
你是想要答案
You looking for answers

354
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:12,432
还是想找人顶罪
or you looking for someone to pin it on?

355
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:14,067
你是个聪明的人 Gibbs探员
You're a smart man, Agent Gibbs.

356
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:15,502
我不会和你争论
I won't argue with you.

357
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:17,604
但是你知道这样做的结果
But you know where this is headed.

358
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:19,773
你不能改变法律
You can't change the law.

359
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:22,275
是的 我们不能
No, we can't.

360
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:26,380
但我们可以竭尽全力 据理力争
But we can fight like hell and we can try.

361
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,647
我不知道你来了 Gibbs
I didn't know you come here, Gibbs.

362
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,715
非常不错的一杯咖啡
Pretty good cup of coffee though, huh?

363
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:49,317
我们的小秘密 对吗
Our little secret, right?

364
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:51,052
对
Right.

365
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:52,820
再见 Norvell
See you, Norvell.

366
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:00,762
为什么你坚持在这里见我
Why do you insist on meeting me here?

367
00:16:00,764 --> 00:16:02,830
别告诉我是因为这里的食物

对你父亲的离世我感到很难过
I'm sorry about your dad.

373
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:19,347
他会非常乐意遇见你
He would've loved to have met you.

374
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:22,250
传言说他和他儿子一样有挑战性
Rumor has it he was as challenging as his son.

375
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,988
是的 嗯 只是保守说法
Yeah, well, there's an understatement.

376
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,357
我喜欢好的挑战
I like a good challenge.

377
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:37,565
前海军医护兵尽力拯救生命

378
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:40,034
现在她面临司法指控

379
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:41,970
体系的缺陷
Flaw in the system.

380
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:43,638
体系需要完善
System needs to be fixed.

381
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,073
嗯 很多人都会同意
Well, a lot of folks would agree,

382
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:47,041
但我能帮你做什么
but what can I do to help?

383
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:49,877
她需要一个律师
She needs a lawyer.

384
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,179
Carrie 她需要一个好的律师
Carrie, she need a good lawyer.

00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:54,215
我们不会赢
We won't win.

387
00:16:54,217 --> 00:16:55,783
我知道 但你可以减轻指控
I know that, but you can lessen the charges,

388
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:59,354
然后我们与之对抗
and we take the fight to them.

389
00:16:59,356 --> 00:17:00,855
再然后呢
And then what?

390
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:03,725
然后你告诉我该去和哪些人谈判
Then you tell me the right people to talk to.

391
00:17:05,428 --> 00:17:07,161
但现在...
But right now...

392
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:08,896
我们是她仅有的一切
we're all she's got.

393
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,635
在她为了她的国家奉献了一切之后
After what she did for her country,

394
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:16,204
她应该得到一些支持
she deserves some support.

395
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:22,210
好吧 你欠我一次
Well, you will owe me.

396

非常抱歉
I'm sorry, um...

409
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:09,424
我们说到哪了
where were we?

410
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,926
说完了 只要在你的口供上签字就行
Finished, just need you to sign your statement.

411
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:16,431
嘿 老大
Hey, boss.

412
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:17,532
我们这里都结束了
We're all done here.

413
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:19,534
真希望我能记起更多关于SUV的事儿
Wish I could remember more about the SUV.

414
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:22,036
我没能帮得上任何人 哈
I'm not being much help to anybody, huh?

415
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:23,504
好了 我们最好快走
All right, we better get moving.

416
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:25,807
我们就要一路堵回费尔法克斯了
We're gonna fight traffic all the way back to Fairfax.

417

430
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,952

我犹豫了
I hesitated.

440
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:37,445
如果我能尽快 我...

441

唯一能拯救这个人生命的方法是

从一开始就不曾经历这场事故
is if he never got into the accident in the first place.

445
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,524
正如我的指挥官在一场
As my commanding officer once said,

446
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:52,226
极度激烈的战斗后曾说的

447

"你没开枪
“You didn't fire the shot,

448
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:57,632
"所以你不能把所有逝去的生命都归咎于自己
“so you can't blame yourself for those you lose.

449
00:19:57,634 --> 00:20:00,234
你不可能救所有人"

450
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:09,210

454
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,020
是的 但也因为我发现了线索

Hicks士官的车辆被追尾

车尾部没有留下油漆
There was no paint left behind

459
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:31,265
所以我不能追踪凹痕

460
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:32,567
但是...
But...?

拜托接下来一定要有但是
Please say there's a but.

462

但是
There's a but.

463
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:38,172
等等 你说这话是不是因为我请求你这么说
Wait, are you just saying that because I asked you to?

464
00:20:38,174 --> 00:20:39,440
行了 直接说重点
Please, just get to the point.

465
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:42,543
重点是有油漆留下 看到没
The point is there was paint left behind. See?

466
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:46,447
我只看到银色
All I see is silver.

467

473
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:04,765
好吧 只要相信我就好

记得提醒我绝不要向你们咨询室内设计
And remind me to never consult any of you on interior design.

We need to match the model 266 or 272.

在你们来找过他之后
Dave got kind of antsy-pantsy

627
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:17,525
Dave就变得坐立不安
when you guys paid him a visit.

628

might have something to do with the death of that Navy kid.

633
00:27:30,406 --> 00:27:33,307
你不会恰好是昨晚在Manchester俱乐部
You wouldn't happen to be the female agent that got into it

634
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:36,010
与Woody发生争执的女探员吧

635
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,481
呃 对 他不太喜欢我
Uh, yeah, he wasn't so happy with me.

636
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:43,451
我也许摔了几个装着花生的碗
There may have been a few peanut bowls thrown.

637
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,485
嘿 我不会介意那事

听着 我们知道Dave的卡车不见了

640
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:50,024
就把你知道的告诉我们

我最后一次见到Dave是在几小时前

642

643

有什么事这么重要
What's so important it couldn't wait

646
00:28:05,108 --> 00:28:06,674
不能等到你出了卫生间再说

647
00:28:06,676 --> 00:28:08,576
你在说什么 我没有给你发信息
What are you talking about? I didn't text you.

我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

650
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:15,282
你知道 男人才能进男厕所
You know, the “men” in “men's room”

651
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:17,551
这是个规矩不是个建议 菜鸟
is more of a rule than a suggestion, probie.

652
00:28:17,553 --> 00:28:21,756
听着 你们俩经常一起说笑着来上厕所
Look, you two always get to go off giggling

653
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:24,592
而我却被扔在一边
to the urinal together and I always get left out.

654
00:28:24,594 --> 00:28:26,994
所以我们要谈谈 而且要在这里谈
So we're gonna talk, and we're gonna do it here.

Tony 这是秘密

666
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:57,958
要真是个秘密 你们是怎么知道的
If it's so secret, how do you know about them?

667
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:00,294
这个问题问得好
That's a very good question.

668
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:02,863
我去守着门
I'll guard the door.

669
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:11,238
好吧...
All right...

670
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,841
你或许应该知道 我和Abby约会过

Wait, isn't that a violation of Rule 12?

674
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:20,815
-不能和... -很久之前的事了
- Never date a... - It was a long time ago.

675
00:29:20,817 --> 00:29:24,752
在我们分手之后的一个晚上 我去到她的实验室
After we had broken up, one night, I went to her lab,

676
00:29:24,754 --> 00:29:27,354
发现一张字迹潦草的纸 一张表

679
00:29:33,462 --> 00:29:35,596

680
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:37,731
开始还比较正常
Well, things start off relatively normal:

681
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:39,166
为她开门
Opening the door for her,

682
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:41,402
买花 拉椅子...

大概到了... 第八条...
Then, around... number eight...

684

她知道你拍下这些了吗

00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,830
我们在一起的时候 还没有这些要求
Those rules weren't in place when we were together.

693
00:30:09,832 --> 00:30:11,732
至少 我觉得没有...

694
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:14,168
两个月截止点是怎么回事

697
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:18,339
我们必须跟她谈谈
We have to talk to her.

698
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:19,473
不 不 不 不
No! No, no, no!

699
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:21,208
不 你什么都不能说
No. You cannot say a word.

700
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,377
如果你说了 Abby就知道是我告诉你的了
If you say anything, Abby'll know I told you.

701
00:30:23,379 --> 00:30:25,212
相信我们 Bishop
Trust us, Bishop.

702
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:26,413
Abby的约会世界就是个大漩涡
The Abby dating world is a vortex

703
00:30:26,415 --> 00:30:27,748
你不会想卷进去的
you do not want to get sucked into.

704
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,984
有时候... 太复杂了
Sometimes... it's complicated.

705
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:31,719
就让她做自己吧
Just let Abby be Abby.

706
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:37,024
我整晚都在浏览相关的法律法规
I spent all night looking through relevant statutes.

707
00:30:37,026 --> 00:30:38,392
然后呢
And?

708
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:40,027
你知道你的所作所为是违法的
And you know what you did was illegal.

709
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:42,730
你被抓时在往一个女孩的喉咙里
You were caught holding a tracheotomy tube

710
00:30:42,732 --> 00:30:43,697
插气管
in a girl's throat.

711
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:44,999
她救了两条人命
And she saved two lives.

712
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:46,667
她所做的是海军训练她去做的事
She did what the Navy trained her to do.

713
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:48,168
那多少是有帮助的
That's got to count for something.

714
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,638
如果她是陆军或空军的话 是的
If she was in the Army or in the Air Force, yes.

715
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,740
她就会有急救医生的基本证明
She would be EMT-Basic certified.

716
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:55,175
但海军训练并不归入国家许可
But Navy training doesn't fall under state licensure.

717
00:30:55,177 --> 00:30:57,344
所以我会因为技术细则而坐牢
So I'm going to jail for a technicality?

718
00:30:57,346 --> 00:30:58,712
我帮你的话就不用坐牢了
Not if I can help it.

719
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,882
我想我们最明智的选择就是承认你所做的事
I think that our best move is to admit what you did.

720
00:31:01,884 --> 00:31:02,983
寻求法律帮助
Go after the law itself?

721
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:04,752
正是 法律并不是要
Exactly. This wasn't intended

722
00:31:04,754 --> 00:31:06,053
惩罚像你这样的人
to prosecute people like you.

723
00:31:06,055 --> 00:31:07,021
我们说明当时的情况
We present our case,

724
00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:08,455
告诉他们你受过什么训练...
tell them about your training...

725
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:09,690
当你看到三个孩子垂死之际
that you saw three kids dying

726
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:11,191
你知道自己有能力施救
that you knew that you could help.

727
00:31:11,193 --> 00:31:13,394
并提供你对这起肇事逃逸事故的证词
Throw in your testimony about the hit-and-run.

728
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:16,096
如果海军和受害者家属能站在你这边
If we can get the Navy and the victims' families on your side,

729
00:31:16,098 --> 00:31:18,165
我们就有机会
we stand a chance.

730
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:20,200
好的 我来安排
Okay, I'll set it up.

731
00:31:20,202 --> 00:31:21,268
安排什么
Set what up?

732
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,103
老大 不... 不好意思
Boss, I'm... I'm sorry.

733
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:24,805
他一直在集合厅等你
He was waiting for you in the squad room.

734
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:26,106
McGee 没关系
McGee, it's all right.

735
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:28,375
跟McGee走吧
Go with McGee.

736
00:31:30,913 --> 00:31:33,213
Anna有权找个律师
Anna has the right to an attorney.

737
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:34,448
女士 你了解法律
Ma'am, you know the law.

738
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,330
希望你不会插手这件事
Please tell me you're not going along with this.

739
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:39,019
我们还在寻找凶手
We're still looking for a killer.

740
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:40,220
比如说Dave Lancellotti
Like Dave Lancellotti?

741
00:31:40,222 --> 00:31:41,855
你们找错对象了 Gibbs探员
You're barking up the wrong tree, Agent Gibbs.

742
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:44,024
我了解这个人 我们是同乡
I know the guy; we're all locals.

743
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:46,193
Dave性子可能比较急 但他不会杀人
Dave may be a hothead, but he's no killer.

744
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,395
他是个失踪的急性子
He's a hothead no one has heard from.

745
00:31:49,432 --> 00:31:51,432
听着 警官 我们知道你想要答案
Look, Sergeant, we know that you want answers.

746
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:53,801
我们也想要答案
We want answers, too.

747
00:31:53,803 --> 00:31:57,805
只是想确保我们没有冤枉好人
Just make sure that we're punishing the right person.

748
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:00,708
Gibbs
Gibbs.

749
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,710
LoJack软件找到Lancellotti的卡车了
【注：防盗/寻回车辆的软件】
LoJack on Lancellotti's truck just lit up.

750
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,811
知道位置吗
Get a location?

751
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:04,979
车停着 没有行驶
Parked, not moving.

752
00:32:04,981 --> 00:32:06,213
我想我们找到他了
I think we got him.

753
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,648
过会联系你
I'll call you later.

754
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,782
Anna Dillon怎么办
What about Anna Dillon?

755
00:32:08,784 --> 00:32:10,084
什么怎么办
What about her?

756
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:11,485
我要你保证
I want your word.

757
00:32:11,487 --> 00:32:12,820
这件事结束后
When this is done,

758
00:32:12,822 --> 00:32:14,021
你不能妨碍我的工作
you let me do my job.

759
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:16,123
警官 我们都有工作要做
Sergeant, we will all do our jobs.

760
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:18,092
我也去
I'm coming, too.

761
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:30,571
皮卡有顶棚
Pickup's got a cap.

762
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,606
难怪Anna以为是辆SUV
Explains why Anna thought it was an SUV.

763
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:34,475
行动
Let's move.

764
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,082
盯着他 Bishop
Keep your eyes on him, Bishop.

765
00:32:42,084 --> 00:32:43,650
Dave Lancellotti
Dave Lancellotti!

766
00:32:43,652 --> 00:32:45,319
NCIS
NCIS!

767
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,102
看来是我错了
Guess I was wrong.

768
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,000
有麻烦了 Palmer先生
Oh, more trouble, Mr. Palmer?

769
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:19,169
是Breena 她让我带些牛奶和饼干回去
It's Breena. She's asking me to bring home milk and cookies.

770
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:22,305
还有辣香肠
And pepperoni.

771
00:33:23,575 --> 00:33:25,308
和金枪鱼
And tuna fish.

772
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,878
我希望她不是要辣香肠味的金枪鱼
I hope she doesn't mean pepperoni flavored tuna fish.

773
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,746
怀孕的这个阶段
Yes, well, strange cravings

774
00:33:29,748 --> 00:33:31,982
有奇怪的生理需求再正常不过了
are very common in this stage of pregnancy.

775
00:33:31,984 --> 00:33:35,118
上个礼拜 她用巧克力牛奶做土豆泥
Last week, she used chocolate milk to make mashed potatoes.

776
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,621
哇 我喜欢
Mmm! I love that.

777
00:33:37,623 --> 00:33:40,524
它让我熬过了寄宿学校的头一年
Got me through my first year of boarding school.

778
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:41,725
死者身上有什么发现吗
Anything on our dead guy?

779
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,059
可以肯定
Well, suffice to say,

780
00:33:43,061 --> 00:33:44,961
死者被一枪击中太阳穴
a gunshot wound to the temple

781
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:48,031
对下面的组织造成了毁灭性的伤害
that caused catastrophic damage to the underlying tissue.

782
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:49,666
我想这就是目的所在
I would think that was sort of the point.

783
00:33:49,668 --> 00:33:51,902
但并不是你推测的原因
But not for the reason you surmise.

784
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,069
看这儿
Here.

785
00:33:53,071 --> 00:33:54,404
我们在受害者的指甲下
We found skin and hair fragments

786
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:55,672
发现了皮肤和毛发碎片
under the victim's fingernails.

787
00:33:55,674 --> 00:33:57,407
所以他...
So he...

788
00:33:57,409 --> 00:33:59,109
开完枪之后又碰了伤口
touched the wound after the gun went off?

789
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:01,244
但开枪之后他唯一能做的事就只有
The only thing he could've done after the gun discharged

790
00:34:01,246 --> 00:34:03,313
抽搐
was twitch.

791
00:34:03,315 --> 00:34:04,881
枪伤
The gunshot wound

792
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:07,684
是被用来掩饰一记对太阳穴的致命打击
was used to cover up a fatal blow to the temple,

793
00:34:07,686 --> 00:34:09,186
很可能是用的金属管或者扳手
probably a metal pipe or a wrench.

794
00:34:09,188 --> 00:34:12,722
Lancellotti先生的死被伪造成了自杀
Mr. Lancellotti's death was made to look like a suicide.

795
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:14,124
在皮卡后面的工具箱里
There was a wrench in the toolbox

796
00:34:14,126 --> 00:34:15,258
有一个扳手
in the back of the pickup.

797
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,561
既然如此 你最好去
Well, then, I suggest you go

798
00:34:17,563 --> 00:34:19,763
拿给Abby化验
and have Abby test it.

799
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,833
当JB参军的时候 我就知道
I always knew when JB joined the Navy,

800
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:24,968
他有可能回不来了
there was a chance he wouldn't come back,

801
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,571
但以这样的方式...
but to have it happen this way...

802
00:34:27,573 --> 00:34:29,873
当...
When...

803
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,441
他的母亲去世后
his mother passed away,

804
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:33,577
他就是我的一切
that boy was all I had.

805
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:37,447
现在他却走了
Now he's gone.

806
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,716
我们无法想象
We can't begin to imagine

807
00:34:39,718 --> 00:34:42,619
无法想象你所经历的一切 Hicks先生
to imagine what you're going through, Mr. Hicks.

808
00:34:46,825 --> 00:34:48,525
你就是那个人
You're the one?

809
00:34:48,527 --> 00:34:51,194
那个停下来帮忙的人
The one who stopped and helped?

810
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:54,364
他们说你原来是个医生
They said you used to be a medic?

811
00:34:54,366 --> 00:34:55,499
医护兵
A hospital corpsman.

812
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:57,067
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

813
00:34:58,403 --> 00:34:59,870
谢谢
Thank you.

814
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,907
Hicks先生
Mr. Hicks...

815
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:05,141
叫我John
Call me John.

816
00:35:05,944 --> 00:35:08,144
John
John.

817
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:12,549
我刚到那的时候 JB几乎说不出话了
When I first got there, JB could hardly speak.

818
00:35:12,551 --> 00:35:14,951
但即便如此
But even still,

819
00:35:14,953 --> 00:35:17,854
他所关心的仍是他的朋友们
all he cared about was his friends.

820
00:35:17,856 --> 00:35:19,489
他让我帮助他们
He told me to help them.

821
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:22,859
先救他们
Help them first.

822
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:26,663
他自始至终都英勇无畏
He was courageous all the way to the end.

823
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:27,931
你应该为他骄傲
And you should be proud.

824
00:35:29,635 --> 00:35:32,102
他这一生我都为之骄傲
I was proud of JB his whole life.

825
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,939
是真的吗
Is it true...

826
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:37,741
你被逮捕了
that you've been arrested?

827
00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:42,679
Anna可能会面临监禁 是的
Anna is facing potential jail time, yes.

828
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:44,147
什么 这样不对
Well, that can't be right.

829
00:35:44,149 --> 00:35:45,415
她救了
She saved

830
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:46,850
那些孩子
those kids' lives.

831
00:35:46,852 --> 00:35:48,018
也许是不对
It might not be right,

832
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,786
但那是法律
but it's the law.

833
00:35:49,788 --> 00:35:51,688
Anna需要你的帮助 Hicks先生
Anna needs your help, Mr. Hicks.

834
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,089
尽管提
Say the word.

835
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:54,958
只要她需要
Whatever she needs.

836
00:35:59,965 --> 00:36:01,865
听说你在扳手上找到DNA了
I heard you found the DNA on that wrench.

837
00:36:01,867 --> 00:36:04,501
没错 两组DNA还有一些血迹
Yep, two samples and some blood.

838
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:07,871
有人试图清洗干净 但是
